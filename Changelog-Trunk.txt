AS OF SVN REV. 5091, WE ARE NOW USING TRUNK.  ALL UNTESTED BUGFIXES/FEATURES GO INTO TRUNK.
IF YOU HAVE A WORKING AND TESTED BUGFIX PUT IT INTO STABLE AS WELL AS TRUNK.

2006/05/30
	* [Optimized]:
	  - clif_specialeffect to use the enums.
	  [Improved]:
	  - buildin_specialeffect and buildin_specialeffect2 to accept effect area 
	    definition. [Lance]
	* [Added]:
	  - Visual Studio .NET 2003 includes for mercenary.c [Lance]
	* Removed the on-die specific code from unit_remove_map and placed it on
	  the corresponding *_dead functions. unit_remove_map should never assume the
	  char died, it is just a "remove from map" function. [Skotlex]
	* Updated status_damage to handle the general death code (clearing status
	  changes, clearing skill related data, sending death packet, etc). The
	  return value from the *_dead functions will tell it what to do or not with
	  the object (death aborted, clear it from map/memory, etc) [Skotlex]
	* Cleaned up pc_dead to take advantage of the fact that status changes are
	  not ended until after the function. [Skotlex]
	* Disabled ontouch npcs triggering on hidden/chase-walk characters. 
	  [Skotlex]
	* Updated/adapted current Homun code to use the status_data update.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Updated map-server Makefile to compile mercenary.* files. [Skotlex]
	* [Fixed]:
	  - Pets attacking even master is dead. [Lance]
	* Fixed battle_calc_weapon_attack damage capping damage to a minimum of 0
	  (negative values should be allowed when attack is absorbed by target's
	  element) [Skotlex]
2006/05/29
	* [Fixed]:
	  - Missing ';' in item #4358 [Lance]
	* [Fixed]:
	  - Missing maps in map index database. [Lance]
	* [Fixed]:
	  - Battle mechanics in battle_check_target [Lance]
	* [Fixed]:
	  - Typo in mob_dead causing crash. Thanks to reddozen and his gang for testing.
	    [Lance]
	* Cleaned up friend list saving and fixed loading of friends.txt file
	  (char-txt) [Skotlex]
	* Added the Arunafeltz maps, not tested yet [Playtester]
	- someone with an up-to-date client should test them
	* Fixed pc_gainexp resetting your exp to 0 rather than adding it in...
	  [Skotlex]
	* Corrected aspd calculation code to avoid negative overflows. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed battle_check_target check on BCT_ALL to check versus BL_CHAR
	  instead of BL_PC and BL_MOB [Skotlex]
	* [Fixed]:
	  - Declaration of int map_getcellp(struct map_data*,int,int,cell_t); [Lance]
	* Removed Undead being inmune to poison status. [Skotlex]
	* Removed speed penalty from SC_SKA [Skotlex]
	* Fixed SC_SPURT triggering on Soul Linkers. [Skotlex]
	* SC_DODGE won't be dispelled on death now. [Skotlex]
	* [Fixed]:
	  - pc_follow_timer possible triggering crash.
	  - pc_reg_received to use battle_status.hp instead of status.hp
	  [Added]:
	  - macro map_id2index for non-cyptic mapid to mapindex conversion. [Lance]
	* Added a division by zero check in mob_dead to prevent the (impossible)
	  case where a mob dies with received damage of zero. [Skotlex]
	* Modified skill_get_range2 to return range 9 for skills with range 0 for
	  Non-Players. This usually signals Self skills, and mobs/pets should be able
	  to use them in other characters. [Skotlex]
	* Optimized a bit the SC_PROVOKE code (to use val3/val4) [Skotlex]
	* Fixed draining when the amount drained is negative (invoke zap rather
	  than heal) [Skotlex]
	* Implemented GS_FLING as per the current skill description. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed pc_readparam/pc_setparam to use battle_status.hp/sp rather than
	  status.hp/sp, fixes scripts reading the wrong Hp/Sp values [Skotlex]
	* Added some missing SC_* entries on the initial listing (potion related
	  and speed up ones) [Skotlex]
	* Fixed function declaration of map_getcellp() [Skotlex]
	* [Fixed]:
	  - status.c:920: warning: 'mbl' might be used uninitialized in this function
	  - skill.c:6648: warning: 'matk_min' might be used uninitialized in this function
	  - skill.c:6648: warning: 'matk_max' might be used uninitialized in this function
	  - skill.c:2826: warning: 'sid' might be used uninitialized in this function [Lance]
	* [Optimized]:
	  - Removed unused variable (account_id) in storage_guild_storagesaved.
	* [Optimized]:
	  - Removed unused checks for unsigned data type and possible logic error for
	    char type (gcc treats char as unsigned). [Lance]
	* [Fixed]:
	  - Relogging in with 0 HP didn't trigger dead event. [Lance]
2006/05/28
	* Added functions status_revive, pc_revive and mob_revive to handle revival
	  (it doesn't handles player respawning, though). Fixed reviving @ commands.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Added SC_BLADESTOP to the skill enum at the beginning of status.c (fixes
	  Bladestop causing an unknown status change message). [Skotlex]
	* Fixed MSS_DEAD state skills not triggering. [Skotlex]
	* Changed undeads to by default always sustain 100% of the damage from firewalls [MasterOfMuppets] 
	* [Fixed]: 
	  - script functions that doesn't pass references, thanks to End_of_exam. [Lance]
	* [Protected]:
	  - clif_parse_LGMmessage from possible hacks [Lance]
	* Fixed unable to store n items into storage unless n was the total amount
	  of items you had. [Skotlex]
	* Suppressed compilation warnings (unsigned and signed mismatches) [Lance]
2006/05/27
	* Added structure status_data which holds status-related information (str,
	  agi, etc, speed, amotion, adelay, dmotion, weapon-damage, race, size, etc)
	  and weapon_atk structure with the weapon specific info (atk, atk2, element)
	  to be used by all combat structures (TODO: Homun needs to be updated to use
	  it). This in change involves a LOT of changes throughout the code and many
	  optimizations were done as well. Partial list (see svn changelog for complete
	  changes): [Skotlex]
	- NOTE: Changes are substantial! I tested a bunch of stuff and all the
	  skills I changed the most, but it is possible there are unnoticed bugs
	  remaining to fix!
	- Cleaned up TBL_PC, TBL_MOB, TBL_PC and mob_db structures to use status_data.
	- Split damage received functions into pc_damage/pc_dead and mob_damage/mob_dead
	- Added status functions to deal with damage and healing (status_damage,
	  status_heal, status_percent_change) and a bunch of defines for easier
	  handling of them (status_percent_heal, status_percent_damage,
	  status_fix_damage, status_kill, etc). Objects must be hurt/healed through
	  THIS, pc_damage/mob_damage most no longer be directly invoked!
	- Rewrote and cleaned up battle_calc_misc_attack
	- Merged config options pc_attack_attr_none, mob_attack_attr_none,
	  pet_attack_attr_none into attack_attr_none (type 4)
	- Removed config options player_defense_type, monster_defense_type,
	  pet_defense_type in favor of weapon_defense_type
	- Modified skill_calc_heal to take into account the MEDITATION bonus.
	- Modified Slim Pitcher so it will work when casted by non-players. Will
	  now also work with SP-healing items.
	- Rewrote Freedom of Cast code to use function status_freecast_switch to
	  switch adelay/speed when cast begins/ends.
	- Modified Magic Power to store amplified MATK/MATK2 in val3/val4 for
	  easier updating when used in conjunction with ground skills.
	- Fixed Asura Strike being usable from within a combo regardless of combo skill.
	- Added status_calc_bl which does status-change related calculations using
	  as base the base_status of the bl object and the SCB_* flag passed. This is
	  invoked on status changes, and status_calc_pc will no longer be invoked
	  (which results on much faster status-change calculations).
	- pc_clean_skilltree will now also remove item-granted skills.
	- Learning skills will now only invoke status_calc_pc when the skill is passive.
	- Cleaned up pc_check_base/job_lvup to only invoke the lv-up related
	  packets and functions ONCE regardless of skill-levls earned.
	- Cleaned up pc_ regen related functions.
	- Made player-sprite mobs have item pickup animation and walkdelay when taking items.
	- Clones will copy a player's base status rather than battle status (so
	  status-change alterations are not cloned)
2006/05/26
	* Part B of the homunculus code. [blackhole89]
	  While most of the homunculus handling functions are in now, it still lacks
	  code required for players to create it.
	  Given I haven't screwed up, you could master yourself one through the DB though.
	* Fixed crashing in mob.c [Lance]
	* Patches to allow everything to work right. + 1 more sample script. [Lance]
	* Mob control engine tested 99% working so far. [Lance]
	* Change scripting engine's NPC scope vars to dot (.) style.
	* Improved and (should be fully) fixed the mob control engine. [Lance]
	* Fixed typos in char.c [Lance]
	* Rewrote fame rank lists system to reduce char-server load, as requested by
	  Skotlex: now it has a copy of those lists, and updates only the proper one
	  when needed instead of rebuilding all from saves everytime (which required
	  to always save the character before rebuilding the lists) [DracoRPG]
	  - Note it hasn't been compiled nor tested with SQL, please do it for me
2006/05/25
	* Simplified ASC_BREAKER by making it a BF_WEAPON attack with an additional
	  int-based damage component (which is added right before elemental
	  modifiers) as described by AuronX. Pending further refining. [Skotlex]
	* Resolved differences between Stable/Trunk msg_athena.conf. [Lupus]
		Fixed atcommand @request MSG numbers accordinly.
		On adding new MSG strings, plzm reserve them in STABLE msg_athena.conf, too
	* Added NoVending mapflag. You may disable vending in the streets [Lupus]
	* Increased capacity for Account Variables to 64 [Skotlex]
	* Reverted Intravision implementation to that of stable's. [Skotlex]
	* Corrected Login Server taking it's first argument as both login config
	  and lan config. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed mob control commands.
	* Fixed memory leak in scripts (again). Still have a few lying. [Lance]
2006/05/24
	* Fix to the slave AI problem. [erKURITA], by [Skotlex], reported by Niktout.
	* Item sharing now shares the same rules as exp sharing (no sharing when
	  dead, or idle, etc) [Skotlex]
	* Fixed summoned slaves being able to cast onspawn summon-skills (slaves
	  aren't supposed to be able to call minions) [Skotlex]
	* The clif_skill_poseffect packet will not be invoked in Snap unless the
	  skill was successful. May fix the client-position lag. [Skotlex]
	* Merged item_db.sql from stable (the one from stable was more recent than
	  the one of trunk...) [Skotlex]
	* Corrected SL KA* spells not working on other Soul Linkers. [Skotlex]
	* Corrected a pair of incorrect sql query parsing logic in the login-sql
	  ban request packet. [Skotlex]
2006/05/23
	* Corrected mob angry mode, now it only "restores" itself after being hit
	  when the mob has no target within their range of sight rather than on
	  picking a new target. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed wedding sprite where it would stay active after unequipping. [Zido]
	* Some cleanup of run_script, should fix the memory leak there. [Skotlex]
	* the charname request hack message has been downgraded to only include
	  GM-invisible characters. [Skotlex]
	* corrected clif_charnameack to send negative ID when a disguised player
	  asks for it's own disguised name. [Skotlex]
	* Cleaned up the disguised target-id checks taking into considering that
	  the only character that sees a negative ID is the same disguised character.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Modified battle_calc_weapon_attack to use new flags pdef/pdef (pierce
	  defense), Investigate and Icepick will now use the final def/vit-def values
	  rather than the base ones. [Skotlex]
	* The move-enable condition checks for skills are now checked for only when
	  on skill use, not at cast-end time. [Skotlex]
	* Corrected clif parse name request failing on disguised characters [Skotlex]
	* Corrected Soul Drain draining from all non-ground-based skills including
	  non-magic attacks. [Skotlex]
	* Corrected pc_setoption to change the option and then change class.
	  changing option-wedding will automatically convert the view-class as well.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Corrected the 15% drop rate increase when killing higher level mobs in
	  pk-mode triggering for all mobs with lower level than yourself. Thanks to
	  Vayu. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed typo (this time it's not my fault) in script_reload() clearing the same
	  db each time o_o [Lance]
	* Fixed sleep command. [Lance]
	* Added 'setd' support for local NPC scope (') variables. [Lance]
	* [Scripting Engine Update] New variables are ready to be used. [Lance]
2006/05/22
	* Updated skill_delayfix to return 0 for mobs since they have no skill
	  delay other than the one specified in mob_skill_db [Skotlex]
	* Corrected the 20 lvl diff 15% exp bonus on pk_mode servers. Thanks to
	  Vayu for pointing it out. [Skotlex]
	* status_get_sc_tick will now use directly Stun's formula rather than
	  invoking the status sc chance once. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed a possible null pointer in script command misc_effect [Skotlex]
	* Modified Investigate to take into consideration final def/vit-def rather
	  than base values for damage adjustment. [Skotlex]
	* WARNING: New scripting system contains memory leak
	  TODO: Free all scripts using script_free_code() instead of old methods. [Lance]
	* Excluded idle and auto-trade party members from TK_POWER list. [Lance]
	* Fixed compilation errors.
	  Tidy up jobmaster for easy debugging. [Lance]
2006/05/21
	* Part A of the Homunculus code.
	  This only features the structures, status_* and clif_* (packets) and is
	  not functional yet in any conventional way, but doesn't interfere
	  with present functionality either.
	  Main purpose is helping me to keep my work organized. [blackhole89]
	* Fixed the "fake" mute status bug. [Zido]
	* Speed up array size calculation and deletion. [Lance]
	* Player must learn the skill before doing auto-spell [Lance]
	* Exploit prevention in clif_parse_NpcStringInput [Lance]
	* SC_SPEARSQUICKEN -> SC_SPEARQUICKEN normalized enum name [Lupus]
	* Thanks to damirych & Falcon for [2006/04/30] STEAL skill [Lupus]
2006/05/20
	* grfio_final moved back if any of GRF overriding is enabled so servers
	  with such configuration will not have different values after reloading. [Lance]
	* jA1983 script.c buildin_menu fix. Thanks to End_of_exam. [Lance]
	* Abit of alterations to login-server. [Lance]
2006/05/19
	* Minor unsigned/signed alteration in pc_additem to shut the compiler up. [Lance]
	* Small change in pc_additem that could be fixing the current bug with new
	  items not getting added. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed loginlog definition in main.sql, thanks to Tempesta [Skotlex]
	* Likely fixed the mob-skill random picking behaviour causing infinite
	  loops sometimes. [Skotlex]
	* Modified mobskill_use behaviour to pick a random starting point and check
	  skills from that, rather than always checking from first to last. Fixes
	  skills with high priority blocking skills lower down in the list from
	  triggering. [Skotlex]
	* Updated mob ai behaviour so that mobs use IDLE state skills when their
	  current target cannot be reached for melee fighting. [Skotlex]
2006/05/18
	* Added 5 config settings to adjust damage in pk-mode servers (misc.conf)
	  [Skotlex]
	* Fixed mob_max_skilllvl being capped to 11! [Skotlex]
	* Rewrote/cleaned up several functions in storage.c [Skotlex]
	* Optimized pc_additem comparisons to account for items with more than four
	  slots. [Skotlex]
	* Updated clif.c to enable retrieval of items from cart/storage while
	  trading. Exception is retrieving items from the cart while vending.
	  [Skotlex]
	- The reasoning is that an ongoing trade will not get "corrupted" if you
	  earn items before it is commited (only if you lose items from your
	  inventory), and it is an annoyance when you realize the stuff you want to
	  trade is on the cart/storage.
	* skill reiteration code now does not checks for the trigger-area of the
	  skill in the case of non-players, which means mobs can now place traps in
	  cells adjacent to each other. [Skotlex]
	* Applied an experimental weather code that should lower bandwidth usage to
	  near-none, which's only disadvantage should be the weather not clearing out
	  until moving to another map (even when the mapflag is removed from the
	  current map). Please test and report if there's any anomalies with it.
	  [Skotlex]
	* NPC_AGIUP will now give movement boost of 50% [Skotlex]
	* Fixed WZ_WATERBALL number of hits when used by non-players. [Skotlex]
	* MO_BODYRELOCATION will send the slide packet with the actual src's
	  coordinates rather than selected tile. [Skotlex]
2006/05/17
	* Modified mob_can_changetarget to return true always when the new target
	  is the provoked-by character. Fixes provoke not making the mob change
	  target when it already is locked on another player. [Skotlex]
	* Added check to clear previous skill when combo time ends. Should fix TK
	  Rankers being unable to initiate a combo with the same kick their previous
	  combo was finished with. [Skotlex]
	* Power Up and Agi Up now increase Hit/Flee by 20%/lv [Skotlex]
2006/05/16
	* Modified "hide woe damage" to send the number of hits rather than 1 as
	  damage Because when the damage is less than the number of hits, the client
	  will display MISS. [Skotlex]
	* Fire Pillar will now do 200%MATK damage per hit when level is >10.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Blood Drain always hits now. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed Mob Area Skills not updating their use-time (rendering their skill
	  delay useless) [Skotlex]
	* Search free cell will now skip picking the center-tile as target
	  location. Will prevent slaves from walking on top of their master, or mobs
	  placing stuff right under themselves with the "around" target conditions
	  among other things. [Skotlex]
2006/05/15
	* Small changes to the skill.conf
	- Monsters now can place ground skills on top of each other by default
	- Land_Skill_Limit format changed and set to "Only Players" by default
	* When reading mapflags, when a map is set to be pvp or gvg, the other will
	  be turned off (disables pvp mapflags in gvg maps for pk-servers) [Skotlex]
	* Firepillar's damage per hit is now 100% MATK (rather than 20%) when the
	  skill level is above 10. [Skotlex]
	* Sorted out the item_data structure, getiteminfo should work correctly
	  now. [Skotlex]
	* KA* skills can now be casted on other Soul Linkers as well without the
	  Spirit requirement. [Skotlex]
	* Soul Drain will now show the SP drained regardless of drain display
	  settings. [Skotlex]
	* SC_COMBO state will now end in skill_attack rather than
	  skill_check_condition (as it is required there to apply damage bonuses
	  based on combo-casted skills) [Skotlex]
	* Fixed Option_Wedding in const.txt (0x1000 won't work, it has to be 4096)
	  [Skotlex]
	* Fixed the nocast flag 2 (not usable in pvp) returning true in pk-mode
	  servers. [Skotlex]
	* When removing a castle's owning guild, the char servers will erase the
	  guardian data now. [Skotlex]
	* Changed the behaviour of immobile mobs when they can't chase their
	  target. Rather than using a longrange skill and then unlocking, they will
	  use an attack/angry state skill and then unlock. [Skotlex]
	* Some adjustments of how disguising + gm-hiding work together. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed clif_GlobalMessage being the exact same function as clif_message
	  (the first should send to ALL_CLIENT and the later should send to
	  AREA_CHAT_WOS). Should fix globalmes script command. [Skotlex]
	* Added SC_BLADESTOP to the switch listing in status_change_start [Skotlex]
	* Characters in vending are now always considered "idle" if the
	  idle_no_share setting is active. [Skotlex]
	* Players with OPTION_INVISIBLE should not be sent to clients. [Lance]
	* Remaining fixes for item scripts. [Lance]
	* Added NPC event deprecated warnings to ease debugging old scripts. [Lance]

2006/05/12
	* Supplied fake NPC ID in sd->npc_id for item scripts. [Lance]
	* Bugfix on fake npc [Lance]
	* Fixed mob_once_spawn not working for non-random coordinates. [blackhole89]
	* Reverted again the change that stuns the caster on Ske, Ska, Swoo when
	  the target is a nonplayer (rather than always) [Skotlex]
	* Modified mob_spawn_once so that coordinates -1,-1 are "random around the
	  player" while 0,0 are random around the whole map (regardless of whether
	  there's a player attached or not) [Skotlex]
	* Knockback will no longer work on traps during woe. [Skotlex]
2006/05/11
	* Fixed the definition of the KEY in the loginlog, thanks to TheUltraMage
	  [Skotlex]
	* NPC_POWERUP and NPC_AGIUP now cause a increase in hit/flee (respectively)
	  of 40% per level. [Skotlex]
	* Changed a bit the MAX_ZENY checks in trade.c to prevent overflows.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Rewrote npc_selllist for a more proper-clean implementation. [Skotlex]
	* Increased NPC_POWERUP's dex bonus to +25*lv [Skotlex]
	* Moved TK_DOWNKICK's stun time from time to time2 [Skotlex]
	* Added TK_TURNKICK's stun to splash-pushed mobs. Duration is 2secs (time2)
	  [Skotlex]
	* Merged the code for Ska, Ske, Swoo together. Swoo stun duration is now 10
	  secs (reducable) if you target a mob that already has Swoo active. [Skotlex]
	* Added the missing semi-comma from the upgrade_svn6533.sql file. Thanks to
	  Tanaous [Skotlex]
	* Added back the missing code that substracts arrows when normal-attacking.
	  [Skotlex]
2006/05/10
	* Changed the state of Asura back to explosionspirits, added a hardcoded
	  move_enable check when invoking Asura and NOT while in BladeStop or a
	  Combo. [Skotlex]
	* Added back SC_XMAS to status.c, it got lost sometime during all the
	  previous reworkings. [Skotlex]
	* Changed wedding costumes to use setoption rather than changebase.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Modified setoption so that flag 1 or no flag adds an option, and flag 0
	  removes it. [Skotlex]
	* Updated script_commands with the new behaviour. [Skotlex]
	* Updated mob_db2.txt and mob_db2.sql to have only 10 drop slots rather
	  than 15. [Skotlex]
	* Users are now able to use their own dnsbl servers (login_athena) [Zido]

2006/05/09
	* Rewrote/cleaned up trade.c for a more clean trading implementation.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Added @request commands, sends a request to all connected GMs of
	  lowest_gm_level or above as a whisper message. Defaults to gm level 20
	  users (UNTESTED). [Skotlex]
	* Modified @commands to use Meruru's code which is faster and does a fair
	  attempt at tabulating the commands presented. [Skotlex]
	* Updated SKA to return a random value between 0 and 99 each time
	  status_get_def is invoked. [Skotlex]
	* Updated Making Arrow to not include unidentified items in the list.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Reduced drop slots from 15 to 10. [Skotlex]
	* Updated mob_db.sql with the current data. [Skotlex]
	* Updated setoption script command to receive a second (optional) argument
	  flag. If the flag is 1, the option is added to what the player currently
	  has; likewise using flag 2 removes only that option. No flag (or any other
	  value) is the older behaviour of removing all other options and setting
	  specificly what is passed. [Skotlex]
	* Updated script_commands information for setoption due to this change.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Small fix in npc-created chat rooms to properly include the terminating 0
	  on the chat's event. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed Fog of Wall's symmetry in respect to Misc attacks, they no longer
	  get reduced by 50% regardless of who is standing on the fog. [Skotlex]
	* monster_ai&2 will now trigger the rude-attacked skill when the mob can't
	  move and the attacker is out of it's attack range. [Skotlex]
	* Added missing icon for Joint Beat [Skotlex]
	* Mob-search functions will now skip enemies with no exp/job_exp. [Skotlex]
	* Treasure chests will now be excluded from the mob-drop listings
	  (@whodrops) [Skotlex]
	* Fix on pc_skill which fixes overlapping when one gets more than one bonus
	  for the same skill. [Skotlex]
	* Updated main.sql's loginlog table structure. [Skotlex]
	* Added svn_update6533.sql to update the loginlog structure as suggested by
	  theultramage. [Skotlex]
	* Cleaned up somewhat the implementation of BladeStop. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed the head_bottom (pet-armor) position in packet 0x22c (walk packet)
	  when crafted for non-players. [Skotlex]
	* Script commands sc_start, sc_start2 and sc_start4 will now start
	  regardless of sc defense of the target player (that is, they cannot be
	  avoided/blocked) [Skotlex]
	* Fixed a possible counter overflow in attacked_count, changed the var size
	  to unsigned char since the code can handle the overflow now. [Skotlex]
	* Multiple targets again reduces armor defense, as reported by Tharis.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Increased dex bonus of NPC_POWERUP to +20 per level. [Skotlex]
	* Fog of Wall's -50 hit reduction is now only for ranged attacks. [Skotlex]
2006/05/08
	* Reverted the change that was making ES skills stun the caster always.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Removed the fixpos packet which is sent whenever you are hit while moving
	  as Aegis doesn't sends this packet neither. [Skotlex]
	* ES magic will now put the caster on stun for 0.5 secs regardless of
	  whether the skill-target is a mob or not. [Skotlex]
	* Added function clif_party_join_info which sends packet 0x1e9 each time a
	  party-member joins. This packet (as redundant info as it has) should also
	  contain the field for "adoptability", but that needs to be coded in yet.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Added clif_ParseAdoptRequest which does the basic adoption handling. More
	  checks and the reply packets still need to be coded in. [Skotlex]
	* Happy State and TK stances won't dispel on death now. [Skotlex]
	* Cleaned up combo-skill implementation, SC_COMBO is automatically ended in
	  skill_check_condition now. [Skotlex]
	* Modified TK-ranker infinite combos to behave as described by AuronX.
	  Refer to his thread in the development section for details. [Skotlex] 
	* Made all Soul Link Spirit skills not be castable on self. [Skotlex]
	* Changed rate of NPC status effect skills to 50+10*lv% base chance
	  (guessed, but better than 100% for all levels) [Skotlex]
	* Changed max level of NPC status effect skills to 5 [Skotlex]
	* Increased max number of tries to find a random spot in maps to 1000 since
	  some maps have so many non-walkable tiles it's hard to find one in just 100
	  tries. [Skotlex]
	* status_set_viewdata will remove the Wedding Option status when you set a
	  class that is not wedding.  [Skotlex]
	* hide_gvg_damage will now send 1 instead of -1 as damage. [Skotlex]
	* idletime will now be updated on attack-request, not on sit/standup
	  [Skotlex]
	* Party members sitting will no longer be considered idle. [Skotlex]
	* Removed SP_DISGUISE from the bonus list (onequip/onunequip should be used
	  with the disguise/undisguise script commands instead). [Skotlex]
	* Moved Sharp Shooting display to the block with Auto-Counter (since that's
	  the other skill that can show critical as well) [Skotlex]
	* Corrected some fields in the standing still packet (guild emblem being
	  stored as a Long when it should be Short) [Skotlex]
	* Modified most fields of view_data to be unsigned shorts rather than
	  signed ones. [Skotlex]
	* On-Touch NPCs will now make you stop walking when you trigger them.
	  [Skotlex]
	* ShadowJump/JumpKick will make you land on the target's cell now.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Fixed Kaahi triggering only once per skill duration. [Skotlex]
2006/05/07
	* Fixed readme/changelog.html [KillerBox]
	* Removed old logs. [Lupus]
	TODO: 1. Add produce logging into PICKLOG 2. Replace map names with map index
2006/05/05
	* Optimized clif.c clif_scriptmenu/input/inputstr to check for sd->state.using_fake_npc
	  before sending one (as it's not required to send twice).
	* Reinitialize sd->state.using_fake_npc in clif_parse_LoadEndAck (for scripts that warps
	  players and still continues execution to work). [Lance]
	* Updated item_db.sql to current. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed a bug in @commands, most likely the reason some people were still
	  getting crashes. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed @commands not showing the last available commands (unless the total
	  amount of commands is divisible by ten) [Skotlex]
	* Added a npc-script-event cache to avoid looking up event-scripts every
	  time they need to be executed. Events cached are all those defined in
	  script_config (on login, logout, mapchange, death, kill, level up) [Skotlex]
	- Since the cache holds direct pointers to the npcs/events, do NOT unload
	  the related NPCs or you'll get dangling pointer crashes. However,
	  @reloadscript will work fine.
	- Set the etc_log to on to see a summary of npcs/events loaded for script
	  execution on startup.
	* The Rest bonus activated by using /doridori while in rest should now
	  trigger with all the class tree (TK/SL/SG) [Skotlex]
	* Fixed Kaupe always triggering when the one who was under Kaupe was a
	  player rather than the one attacking... [Skotlex]
	* /doridori now won't double the HP/SP regen of TKs, it only activates
	  their "happy" state. [Skotlex]
	* Added the -50 hit penalty when standing on Wall of Fog. [Skotlex]
	* Uncommented the status_calc_mdef2 call in status_calc_pc. [Skotlex]
	* Being in Enjoyable Rest state will now also trigger the HP/SP Time skills
	  (even if there's no other TK around). [Skotlex]
	* Added battle config settings view_range_rate and chase_range_rate to
	  adjust the view-range and chase-range (range2/range3) of the mob_db without
	  having to manually change them (battle/monster.conf) [Skotlex]
	* Kaupe now will only block all skills of players, for non-players, only
	  normal attacks can be missed. [Skotlex]
	* Moved the Kaite spell-reflect code after the damage calculation function,
	  so the reflected damage is exactly the damage the original target would
	  have received. Will only trigger if the damage to be reflected is above 0.
	  [Skotlex]
	* OnEquip scripts will now trigger on log-on. [Skotlex]
	* Infinite Endure will no longer give mdef bonus. [Skotlex]
	* Removed bInfiniteEndure bonus, Eddga card now uses onequip/onunequip to
	  start/end infinite endure. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed Kaahi's SP cost per heal. [Skotlex]
	* Now when walkdelay is set to 0, characters will stop walking when hit,
	  but will not have any walk delay. (previously setting walk delay to 0 would
	  not even stop characters from walking when hit) [Skotlex]
2006/05/04
	* Some people think its sexy to declare variables after blocks of code. Fixed. [Zido]
	* Fixed a possible infinite loop in skill_clear_unit_group [Skotlex]
	* Some clean-ups in the mob_ai [Skotlex]
	* Improved atcommand autoloot, now displays droprate in percents and notices
	  player if autoloot is already on or off. Also simplified the code [Harbin, Kain],
	  commited by erKURITA
	* Added one grace range in the mob_loot search function which should fix
	  mob_can_reach failing when invoked with the same distance that distance_bl
	  returned. [Skotlex]
	* Stun time for using ES magic on non-mobs reduced to 0.5 secs. [Skotlex]
	* Eska is now usable on bosses. [Skotlex]
	* Swoo will stun you if attempted on an already 'swooned' enemy. [Skotlex]
	* clif_skill_failed will print out a debug line with the skill_id (since
	  the current null_po does not helps at all to fix it) [Skotlex]
	* Applied TheUltraMage's suggested fixes to the grfio module. [Skotlex]
	* Rewrote Kaahi to behave as it should. It will heal whatever amount of
	  damage accumulates in the time2 interval (500ms by default) after being
	  hit. [Skotlex]
	* Changed skill_unit_move_unit_group to enable moving of all types of
	  ground-skills except ensembles (fixes warmth not following you) [Skotlex]
2006/05/03
	* Kaahi now triggers every 500ms rather than on every hit (but it only
	  heals if in those 500ms an attack that would previously trigger Kaahi has
	  taken effect). In other words, it works just like before, except damage
	  gets "buffered" into 500ms slots. [Skotlex]
	* Kaite, Kaute will now show a skill effect when they trigger. [Skotlex
	* Knowledge will now only trigger if you logon to the memorized map, not
	  walk into it. [Skotlex]
	* Corrected @whomap directly invoking msg_table[] rather than msg_txt()
	  [Skotlex]
	* Guessed where the pet data goes in spawn packet 0x7c. This may be wrong
	  and not fix the pet issue, but I doubt it'll cause any problems that won't
	  be fixed by making the pet move. [Skotlex]
	* Updated Charge Attack's state from none to move_enable. [Skotlex]
	* Made tomahawk an NPC_SKILL so that it may not be plagiarized. [Skotlex]
2006/05/02
	* Fixed standing up not really standing you up. [Skotlex]
	* Moved battle_consume_ammo to the end of skill_castend_damage_id,
	  skill_castend_nodamage_id and skill_castend_pos2 rather than
	  battle_calc_weapon_attack. They will trigger when the player's arrow_atk
	  state is active and a ground skill was not invoked. It should fix all
	  issues with splash/ground skills consuming ammo per target rather than once
	  per skill use. [Skotlex]
	* Added structure state to the ground skills, their fields are magic_power,
	  into_abyss and ammo_consume to indicate the states that were previously
	  stored in val3. [Skotlex]
	* Implemented desperado as explained by Rockman-EXE. The skill-effect is
	  not showing up though, I'll need some logged packets to see what's missing.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Removed the unit_can_move checks in skill cast-end, they should be
	  performed in skill_check_require when the skill's state is move_enabled.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Changed extremity fist's state to move_enabled, the explosion spirits
	  check is now hardcoded. [Skotlex]
	* Absorb Spirit Sphere now gives +10SP per sphere as per discussions with
	  Haplo. [Skotlex]
	* Changed a <= into a < in pc_steal_item. This means drops with 0.01% are
	  impossible to steal unless you have at least 100% steal-rate (where steal
	  rate is dex - opponent dex + skill_lv*3% + 10%) [Skotlex[
	* Cleaned up clif_parse_action_request to enable sitting/standing while in
	  shops, interacting with npcs, etc. [Skotlex]
	* Kaite now works against all types of spells. [Skotlex]
	* Kaupe now works against all skills. [Skotlex]
	* Sanctuary now won't damage non-enemies. [Skotlex]
	* Blessing now will always give you bonus stats even if you are wearing
	  undead armor. [Skotlex]
	* Modified how Rogue's treasure works so that you get +1% to your steal
	  rate rather than +0.01% to the final rate. [Skotlex]
	* Rewrote Warmth to use ground-skill-units, it should behave now like in
	  officials (implementation is not quite the same, but it should yield the
	  same effects while consuming less bandwidth). "Stacking", as it's called,
	  is possible now, but limited to eA's minimum timer skill interval (100ms).
	  [Skotlex]
	* Modified NPC_POWERUP so that it gives +10 dex * skill level rather than
	  +5+lv to all stats (as explained by Playtester and Tharis on how the skill
	  behaves). [Skotlex]
	* Allowed SG_FEEL memorizing the same map for all three. [Skotlex]
	* SC_FUSION won't end when you die now. [Skotlex]
2006/05/01
	* Added knockback when you run into a wall during running. However
	  position is not being refreshed on the client yet... [Skotlex]
	* Fixed pc_disguise not allowing you to "redisguise". [Skotlex]
	* Corrected a crash when sd is null in npc_event [Skotlex]
	* After testing to make sure it works properly, I'm including
	  new battle conf options to limit MVP drops. [Reddozen]
	* Removed OPTION_XMAS, it seems to not exist.... [Skotlex]
	* Added SC_SMA to handle "ready to use SMA" status (rather than SC_COMBO)
	  since it has a visual effect to use. [Skotlex]
	* Corrected the value of OPTION_FLYING [Skotlex]
	* Using SG_FUSION ends Soul Linked effect. [Skotlex]
	* status_setviewdata will set your option accordingly when the previous/new
	  view-class is wedding or xmas suit. [Skotlex]
	* Added function map_foreachinshootrange, behaves the same way as
	  map_foreachinrange, but it also performs a "shoot-path" check before
	  invoking the function. Used in the skill subtimer function if
	  skill_wall_check is defined. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed AL_WARP displaying "Unknown Area" selections when you don't have
	  all memo points used up. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed alive_count not being reset on skill unitsetting, which leads to
	  some groups not being cleared once all their units expire. [Skotlex]
	* Optimized Kaahi/Kahai, will now only show the amount of HP healed. Moved
	  to skill_counter additional effect so it may trigger even on miss. [Skotlex]
	* SKA no longer blocks skills. [Skotlex]
	* Optimized fake npc system. Added npc_checknear back to npc_buysellsel. [Lance]

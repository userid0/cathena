Explanation for modes:
---------------------

CanMove: Enables the mob to move/chase characters.

CanAttack: Enables the mob to attack/retaliate when you are within attack
	range. Note that this only enables them to use normal attacks, skills are
	always allowed.

Looter: The mob will loot up nearby items on the ground when it's on idle state.

Aggressive: normal aggressive mob, will look for a close-by player to attack.

Assist: When a nearby mob of the same class attacks, assist types will join them.

Cast Sensor Melee: Will go after characters who start casting on them if idle
	or during melee attacks (they will leave their current target alone)

Cast Sensor Chase: Will go after characters who start casting on them if idle
	or chasing other players (they switch chase targets)

Boss: Special flag which makes mobs inmune to certain status changes and skills.

Plant: Always receives 1 damage from attacks.

Detector: Enables mob to detect and attack characters who are in hiding/cloak.

ChangeChase: Allows chasing mobs to switch targets if another player happens
	to be within attack range (handy on ranged attackers, for example)

Angry: These mobs are "hyper-active". Apart from "chase"/"attack", they have
	the states "follow"/"angry". Once hit, they stop using these states and use
	the normal ones. The new states are used to determine a different skill-set
	for their "before attacked" and "after attacked" states. Also, when
	"following", they automatically switch to whoever character is closest.

Change Target Melee: Enables a mob to switch targets when attacked while
	attacking someone else.

Change Target Chase: Enables a mob to switch targets when attacked while
	chasing another character.

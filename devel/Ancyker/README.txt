./buildnow                     v1.0 (Initial Release)

 -Really simple script, but automates a few tasks to
   update and compile the latest SVN. You could add
   it to crontab too, though that might have risks.


./installsql                   v1.0 (Initial Release)

 -This one is even simpler, it just downloads and 
   installs MySQL for __CYGWIN__ (NOT FOR LINUX!!!).
   It's for newbs who can't seem to get it right. It 
   needs wget installed for it to run properly. That
   can be found in the web category on CYGWIN.

./installsql2                  v1.0 (Initial Release)

 -Same as above, but this assumes MySQL's source 
   archive is predownloaded already in the same dir.
   You can download the needed file here:
  - http://dev.mysql.com/get/Downloads/MySQL-4.1/mysql-4.1.10a.tar.gz/from/pick#mirrors -

   Note: Don't change the file name.



I'll be adding more soon, so check back often.

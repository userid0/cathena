Date	Added

23/07	* socket.c => Increased WFIFO_SIZE to 64*1024 bytes. The usual size (4*1024) was
	              calculated for the TXT version and is not enough for SQL.

	* pc.c     => Commented out the Karma System section that muted players after PK.

	* mob.c    => Corrected variable types in mob_damage. They were limiting the amount
		      of received base exp (about 65k~) on high-rate servers.

	* chrif.c  => Removed the LANIP check so that users can reach char-server after login.
		      Fix provided by CLOWNISIUS on SVN 2586.

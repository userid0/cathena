the twilight RO server was the primary driving force behind most
of my development effort. 

Well, after we had been turned into gravity multiple times by some
disgruntled players, our original ISP was notified of the "illegal"
activities happening on our machine.  That account was terminated

We then brought the server back up on a new ISP but inside of a day
the ports were blocked for that server as well due to somebody reporting
we were running a illegal emulator

Finally, I was contacted by people representing themselves as 
agents of gravity suggesting I discontinue running twilight RO due
to the illegal nature of the project.  After consultation to 
find out my legal options, we shut down the server on Febuary 7th

While I highly doubt gravity really cared about me compared to other
servers, the methods being used to shut us down was effective.

This directory contains the grave marker of twilight RO.  I will
be placing all the NPC's plus a link to a dump of the database
at the time of termination.

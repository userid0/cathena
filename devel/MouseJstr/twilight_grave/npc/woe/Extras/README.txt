These aren't offical WoE stuff, but add them if you want ^^

woe_gflag.txt and woe_gflag2.txt is a WoE Notice Board that allows you to check up infos on castles you wish to ^^ Pretty useful
Recommend you try it and see how it works out ^^

woe_warper.txt is just a NPC that basically warps you to the 4 Castles Ground Maps.  Prontera, Geffen, Albedaran and Payon.
Might want to reposition it if you wanna use it ^^!! It's useful to teleport around during WoE event hehe...

The Knight Folder contains Knight NPCs which provide you with certain options like warping directly into the Emperium room ^^
Save time walking lolz, and also saving your respawn point with the Knight NPC and a warp back to Prontera if you want ^^
Again it's time saving lolz...

More Custom Work Coming Soon!! Check out your nearby rental outlets for more info!! And hey don't download Van HellSing,
watch it at a Theater!! It's too good a movie to be screwed by piracy!!

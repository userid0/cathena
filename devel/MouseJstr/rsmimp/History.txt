ToDo
====
- RSW loading		30% 
  GND and RSM loading are done so all thats left to do are the RSM 
  transformations... (which is the part I don't understand just yet...)  

- RSM loading		80%
  Texture problems
  Alpha channel - I still have to figure out how to create an alpha channel 
  using magenta color.

- GND Loading		Done!

Yeah! Found out what was wrong with the code... It was leftover code from the 3DSImp plugin
I based the source on.  I really need to clean out my code.

Now GND importing runs quickly and without a glitch. Average load times on a Pentium III 733
are 4 to 5 seconds, compared to 60 or more seconds with the old method.

The fixed bug also solved the missing faces issues, and the wrong real-time textures issue.


4/25/04
=======
Implemented a hash method of storing and finding vertices, and GND loading times have been
lowered considerably. (Like 50 seconds to 5 :))  However it does not solve the problem of
missing faces.  Something else in my code is awry...


4/24/04
-------
Created a VertexList class to handle the GND objects vertices list.
I implemented this so that faces can share vertices, instead of having
its own set of vertices. The immediate result is a lower consumption of memory,
and faster on-screen display.

The first pass stores vertices in the list and throws out duplicates. A hash function
would help with speed, but right now a linear search through an array (slow!) is used
to check if the vertex exists in the list.

A new problem is that only a few of the faces generated seem to be visible in the 3DSMax
object.  A face count produces the expected results, but where are all the faces...?

On a note, removing isolated vertices causes the vertex count to drop (as expected) but the
face count remains the same...  Implying that the remaining vertices are being used by the
missing faces, implying that my FindVertex code doesn't work properly?...

Wow... Three months and no updates...

This is just a minor update. Two flavors of RSMImp are now available.
New RSMImp for 3DSMax 5.0 and the old RSMImp for 3DSMax 3.1

For some reason the compiler keeps linking to "GetRsrcString@@UAEPADJ".
So I have to keep opening up RSMImp.obj and renaming UAEPADJ to UAEPADH
just to get it to compile

I need to fix this...


1/17/04
-------
Texture maps are now automatically enabled during loading.  Means we
can see the textures in the viewport right away instead of enabling them 
one by one.

Also fixed the centering and rotation of the object. Scaling and positioning 
in RSW files aren't quite ok yet.

GND files still need vertex optimization...

humhumhum


11/7/03
-------
Not much work done.  I still have to figure out how to re-use vertices in the
GND file format.  Right now it just creates new vertices for each new face, and
that really hogs memory.  Also, GND objects aren't complete.  All the vertices 
are loaded but only half the faces are displayed.

Defeufeu also brought to my attention the correct method for loading RSM objects
into RSW world space, so I hope to do some work there.

I wish I could get my hands on a Pentium 4 so that work would go more quickly.


9/8/03
------
Found out that texture mapping wasn't working correctly on all models.
For some reason some textures don't map properly.  

I've also separated material assignments.  This is buggy at best as I don't
know exactly how Max stores maps, as far as I know that object materials
are only instanced in the Materials selector. (i.e. Materials selector is 
only a swatch)


9/4/03
------
Material loading complete.  
Added Ragnarok path loading from an INI file in the MAX folder.


9/4/03
------
Texture mapping now works and all I need to do now is create a multi-material,
load the textures into the sub materials, and apply the material to the mesh.

For now, though, you'll have to create the material manually.

To find out which bitmap the mesh uses, I had to use my VB based model viewer
that logs the textures loaded.


9/3/03
------
After several days of staring at 3DS Importer code, I decided to just copy it in 
and tweak it to my needs.  I slowly began to get a glimpse of how the import plugin 
worked and tested by creating a plane.

That being done, I went on to add defeufeu's RSM loading code.  After a few
trials, got it to import vertex and face information.

I still don't know how texture mapping and materials are done, so they're todo for now.

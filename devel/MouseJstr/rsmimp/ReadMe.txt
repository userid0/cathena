RSMImp 3.1
==========
* for 3D Studio MAX 3.1 users ONLY!

Introduction
============
RSMImp.dli is a plugin for importing Ragnarok's RSM, GND files
(and eventually RSW files) into the 3D Studio MAX environment.

If you don't know what Ragnarok Online or 3D Studio Max is, you shouldn't have 
downloaded this :)

This grew directly out of defeufeu's RSMView.

System Requirements
===================
- 3DSMax 3.1
- Ragnarok Online (installed on your computer)
- GrfExtract utility (included in zipfile)
- 1.7GB free hard disk space for extracted Ragnarok data.
- A Pentium 4 1.7 GHz computer, 256MB RAM is recommended.


Installing
==========
- First, you need to extract the "data.grf" file in your Ragnarok folder.
  If you haven't done this yet, go ahead and copy GrfExtract to your 
  Ragnarok folder and run it. It will create a new folder "data" and 
  extract all the models, textures, and sounds there.

  (A lot of files will have weird names, that's ok, they're just in Korean.)

- Extract the file "RSMImp.dli" to your 3DSMax "Plugins" folder

NOTE:
- If you installed Ragnarok in a folder other than "C:\Program Files\Gravity\RagnarokOnline"
  or moved the data folder elsewhere then you MUST open the "rsmimp.ini" file in your 
  3DSMax folder and change the entry to the path where the data folder exists.

The plugin can now be accessed by 3D Studio Max
To use RSMImp:

- Open 3DSMax

- Goto File>Import and select Ragnarok Model (*.RSM) as your file type.

- look for some models in Ragnarok's "data\model\..." folders

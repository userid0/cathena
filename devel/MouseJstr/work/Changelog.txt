	* Changed the way char deletion works for SQL [1051: Ajarn]
	  - If the email the client fails check then check if the
	    email is blank and the DB email is a@a.com (default)
	    If so, assume it was created with _M/_F, and delete it
	* SQL Login accepts _M/_F now [Credit to Sirius] [1049: Ajarn]

          able to set your WAN IP seperate from what interface you
          wish to bind to.  Also, the default is back to binding to
          all interfaces on the machine.  [1045: MouseJstr]

          [celest]

          Note:- minibosses are considered a 'Boss' as well, not just MVP's
        * Fixed a typo that was preventing packet version 5 clients (628sak) from
          logging in (it was supposed to only block those with 4 or below) [celest]

02/04
        * Fixed more compile signed/unsigned errors [SVN 1040: MouseJstr]

        * Added experimental code to generate a stack dump when it segfaults, thanks
          to Ser [celest]
          - does not work with Cygwin, as it does not have glibc
          - to enable, edit the Makefile and remove the # on the line:

                # OPT += -DDUMPSTACK -rdynamic

          - What it does: everytime eA crashes it'll generate a file "stackdump_
            <number>.txt" in your save folder with a backtrace, which you can
            examine and send to a dev to be fixed.

        * Some more tidying up in status_get_ functions [celest]

02/03
        * When loading shop scripts automatically check if the prices can be exploited
          with OC/DC [celest]

          price for an item no need to reset and redetermine the buying price [celest]
        * Fixed a mistake that was causing Ruwach to only work in PvP and PvM [celest]

01/31
        * Fixed a typo in Pressure causing it to deduct sp from the caster, and remove
          its sp_rate requirement [celest]
        * Updated skill_range_leniency code when casting a ground targetting spell      
          ( as in Revision 968) [celest]
        * Added Karma and Manner to const.txt
          -- To change a player's alignment to more Good/Evil in scripting for example,
             use:
                 set Karma, Karma + <number here>;

             In older exe's (11-08 or older) you can actually check your karma in the
             character alignment screen (alt-A)
             The rest is up to your scripting creativity ^^

        * Delete players' ID from id_db when kicking everyone from the map-server due
          to char disconnection -- Fixes an odd crash with lazy mob AI [celest]

        * Fixed a typo that was causing /in to always report failure even when the
          name was removed from the ignore list [celest]
        * Link "wisexin", "wisexlist" and "wisall" to the PM ignore functions, and
         "friendslistadd" and "friendslistremove" to the friends list functions
          when parsing the packet DB [celest]
        * added clif_parse_PMIgnoreList (packet 0xd3) from jA [celest]
        * Added DUMP_ALL_PACKETS and moved dump packets code in clif_parse a bit to
          support it [celest]
        * Added base code for Party Item Sharing -- still needs some work in client-
          server support [celest]
	* new GC link http://amber.stormbirds.org/~joshs/gc6.4.tar.gz
	  This fixes some issues... works better

          by End_of_exam / jA 1108 [celest]
        * Fixed a bug in gettick cache when compiling in Windows, thanks to Shinomori
          (jA 1094) [celest]
        * Added updates from jA 1092 [celest]
          - Changed "read_map_from_bitmap" to "read_map_from_cache",
            "map_bitmap_path" to "map_cache_file" in map_athena
          - Fixed item effects not showing when only one was used

          - Allow only either Storm Gust or Lord of Vermillion to cause damage if
            stacked together
          - Added path_search_long, map_find_skill_unit_oncell

        * Added status_get_sc_def for calculating resistance against status

        * Added status.c and status.h of jA 1091 update and moved some functions into
          the new source files:

          -- battle_get_  ->  status_get_
          -- pc_calc_  ->  status_calc_
          -- pc_getrefinebonus and pc_percentrefinery  ->  status_getrefinebonus and
             status_percentrefinery

        * Updated auto_counter_type's description in battle_athena, thanks to 
          akusarujin for pointing it out [celest]
        * Removed some unnecessary skill level checks in battle.c [celest]
        * Removed my changes to /stable/Makefile which has libGC enabled by default
          that i've accidentally commited, sorry ^^; [celest]
        * Removed an unnecessary "cloneskill_lv" from map_session_data [celest]
	* Removed WATER.TXT (this file wasn't used at all. There's no such mapflag as WATER even). [Lupus]
	* Added Water Height of New Yuno Fileds 9 and 11.
	  Now Water Ball works there as should. Wizards could levelup on sleepers, too. [Lupus]
        * libGC isn't ready to be the default quite yet... [MouseJstr]
        
          Enough people have asked so... Once you grab a copy of the
          libGC library from  (http://amber.stormbirds.org/~joshs/gc6.3.tar),
          you start up a bash shell from inside cygwin and untar
          the gc6.3.tar.  This will produce a gc6.3 directory.  Then
          cd into that directory and type ./configure.  Once that is
          done you type "make" and then "make install".  This will
          spray the various includes and libraries all over your
          cygwin install (most in /usr/local).  

          Now, edit Makefile and change the CC line to use the

             CC = gcc -pipe -DGCOLLECT

          entry.  Also change the GCLIB to 

             GCLIB = -L/usr/local/lib -lgc

          Remember to comment out the ones no longer used.  Do a clean
          build and good luck.  Obviously,  this has not been tested
          by that many people so you really are on the cutting edge
          but if you have good results, send me a note
          (joshs@stormbirds.org) so that we can see if it really is
          ready for prime time.

          What should you see?  Well, the map-server should not
          grow/consume extra memory anymore.  More so, it should use
          dramatically less memory then it did before using the
          garbage collector.

          The downside is that it will consume a little more CPU...

          The question is, how much?  how laggy?   what effect on lots
          of players?  I've heard stories saying it makes the server
          unplayable and others told me that they saw no
          player-visible effects at all.


01/25
        * Fixed TXT compile problems with libGC [celest]
        * Added "Clients older than 2004-09-06aSakray" option to packet_ver_flag in
          battle_athena, just in case server owners still prefer the older clients.
          With so many changes to Sakray over the past months its much better upgrading
          to the newer clients (November or higher recommended) available ;P [celest]
        * Merged Full Strip into jA's tidier stripping skills code -- also fixes
          a typo that was causing Full Strip to do the reverse effect instead,
          and the skill not updating the target's status after successfully unequipping
          items [celest]
        * Tidy up the 4 chemical protection skills into one code block [celest]
        * Corrected Slim Pitcher's code -- sorry, i missed a few things ^^; [celest]

01/24
        * Fixed a typo in Provoke that was causing crashes [celest]
        * Fixed another compile warning in src/char/char.c
          [SVN 985] [MouseJstr]
        * Fixed a account wipe bug in login/login.c (Thanks Wallex)
          [SVN 984] [MouseJstr]
        * Fixed a crash in char_sql/char.c where people were selecting
          chars before requesting connections [SVN 983] [MouseJstr]
        * some G++ compile tweaks and got through several files in the
        map server - [SVN 976]   [MouseJstr]

          Why are we doing a C++ conversion?  We have a lot of duplicate
          code and would like to make the "classes" in the server share
          code.. For example, a pet should be able to share code from
          the player or from a mob.  Similerly, introducing a new type
          of entity in the game should be as simple as creating a
          sub-class instead of having to crawl through the entire source
          tree searching for every class check and introducing handler
          code in for your new type.

          Finally, while a garbage collector is "cool", it would still
          be nice to have enough object knowledge on how to clean up
          data that it is not absolutely required.  It is faster for
          us to clean up our own messes then introduce a whole system
          for cleaning up after ourselves.

          Is there a C++ performance penalty?  Not if the code is
          written correctly.   For example
                  1) No templates - code bloat and destroys cpu cache
                     coheriancy
                  2) No C++ exceptions - slows down entering and
                     exiting functions
                  3) No operator overloading - makes it hard to
                     understand what is going on.
                  4) No C++ STL libraries - Templates, huge, bloated,
                     unportable
                  5) No method inlining - code bloat and reduces cache
                     coheriancy.  Let the optimizer do it...

01/23
	* char-server (SQL & TXT), login-server (SQL & TXT), and txt-coonvertors
	  (char and login) all compile on g++ now [svn 975] [Ajarn]
	* Fixed the sizeof errors in g++ [SVN 972] [Ajarn]
	* Reverted back some of the char* changes [SVN 972] [Ajarn]
	* Changed parse_script to now return char* [SVN 969] [Ajarn] 
	* Converted run_script and run_script_main from unsigned char* to char*
	  [SVN 969] [Ajarn]
	* Forgot a couple small changes [SVN 35] [Ajarn]
	* Changed map_data.gat and map_data_other_server.gat from unsigned char*
	  to char* (this might be needed, because of unicode or something, please
	  correct me if I'm wrong) [SVN 34] [Ajarn]
	* Converted decode_zip, encode_zip, remove_control_chars, mapif_sendall*,
	  and e_mail_check to use char* instead of unsigned char* (again, please test)
	  [SVN 34] [Ajarn]
        * Modified skill unit group checking in skill_unit_onplace that might have
          been causing crashes [celest]
        * Updated packet 0x143 length's for version 14 (2004-11-01Sakexe) and version
          16 (2005-01-10Sakexe), thanks to jathena and ice2big [celest]
        * Fixed login-server compile error with the "new" -> "new_" changes [celest]

01/22
	* Fixed an error that was in my last commit (optimising g++ build) [SVN 29]
	  [Ajarn]
	* Made strlib functions char*, instead of unsigned char*. Strings are meant
	  to be char. (Shouldn't break anything, but might, please test this for me)
	  [SVN 26] [Ajarn]
	* Added cast for TXT version [SVN 25] [Ajarn]
	* Added cast from allocation calls, from void* to intended type [SVN 24] [Ajarn]
	* Changed bool -> bool_. Still need to make convertions between
	  char* and unsigned char* valid, and some other convertions too.
	  Also, sizeof is being used wierd in map.c, at least g++
	  complains [SVN 22] [Ajarn]
	* Changed the rest of the class variable names to class_ and all the new
	  variable names to new_, for futher g++ support [SVN 21] [Ajarn]
        * Update both caster and target's SP after using Soul Change -- thanks to Aalye
          / Freya [celest]
        * Force a monster to switch attack target when being casted Provoke [celest]
        * Corrected description for @enablenpc -- "@npcon" -> "@enablenpc" [celest]
        * Since job normalising is still buggy require all 1st class skills to check
          for Basic Skill level when calculating the skill tree [celest]

01/21
        * Updated packet DB configurations : enable_packet_db, packet_db_ver,
          -- check the .txt for description [celest]

          Note: For people having connection problems try setting 'enable_packet_db'
          to 'no'... and use the latest client (01-10Sakexe)

        * Fixed a small typo in 12-06's packets -- 21b => 21d [celest]
        * Updated packet_db.txt to only contain the latest version, like jAthena,
          since there's not much point to re-read packets eA already supports 
          (although if you remove all the //'s it can still read multiple versions)
          [celest]
        * Added clif_config in clif.c - for keeping packet/client connections related
          stuff [celest]
        * Send 'Game Exe not latest version' to a client if it hasn't been authentified
          yet, but is sending a non-connection-related packet to prevent crashing
          -- assume the client is using an unknown exe [celest]

01/20
	* Fixed compile time problems with the non-GC case [MouseJstr]
	* Introduced aMallocA and aCallocA

	  These two functions allocate "atomic" memory which means 
	  "memory that does not contain references to other memory".

	  This lets the garbage collector ignore these objects when searching
	  memory for references to other objects dramatically increasing
	  performance of the GC.  

	  When in doubt, use aMalloc and aCalloc.  It is better to add
	  a tiny bit of work to the GC then do cause a crash due to memory
	  being cleaned up when it shouldn't.
	  [MouseJstr]
	* Modified all calls to aMalloc and aCalloc that reference
	  atomic memory to use aMallocA and aCallocA
	  [MouseJstr]
	* Modified the socket buffer allocator to use "atomic" memory
	  for the fifo data buffers [MouseJstr]
01/19
	* added support for the Hans-J. Boehm libC garbage collector
	  (A copy is in http://amber.stormbirds.org/~joshs/gc6.3.tar).  

	  It is ABSOLUTELY critical for people to use
	  aFree/aMalloc/aCalloc/aStrdup for this to work.  If somebody
	  has just used free or malloc, this will crash when used with
	  the garbage collector.  

	  A amusing environmental variable to set is GC_PRINT_STATS (to 1)
	  so that you see real time statistics of leaked data being
	  recovered.  

	  grab a copy of the gc6.3.tar.. build it .. install it.. 
	  modify the Makefile to have the 

		CC = gcc -pipe -DGCOLLECT
		GCLIB = -lgc

	  lines... and make the sql servers (the txt server doesn't
	  build using this right now due to stupid Makefile issues)

	  [MouseJstr]
	* SVN 3 on http://svn.stormbirds.org/svn/eathena will be what
	  I diff against when I merge back into delta.. if we ever merge
	  back into delta   [MouseJstr]
        * Removed 12-06 Sakexe detection, since it doesn't seem to work, and
          might be conflicting with 10-25 clients [celest]
        * Update the Soul Burn target's SP when it has been successfully reduced to 0,
          thanks to Aalye / Freya [celest]
        * Moved SC_PRESERVE and SC_BATTLEORDERS's id so they'll display a status icon
          when cast, thanks XiaoLin of cAthena [celest]
        * Added missing code for Preserve -- i totally forgot to add it ^^; [celest]

01/18
        * Added some skill bug fixes, thanks to Aalye / Freya [celest]
          - stop player attacking if the target goes into hiding
          - fixed Sword Reject not working against swords, only daggers
          - additional check in case Marionette Control doesn't end properly even
            when one of the partners has logged off
        * Added stun, bleeding and SP loss effect for Pressure, thanks to DracoRpg
          [celest]
        * TEST: Fixed more compile warnings in MSVC [celest]
        * TEST: Fixed some compile errors in MS Visual C++, thanks to Ser [celest]

01/17
        * Some rewrites in skill_delayfix [celest]
          - If the delay is < 0, add the weapon aspd delay to it
          - If the skill is not weapon type, and has 0 delay, add 300ms as default
        * Added min_skill_delay_limit as the minimum allowed delay for any skills
          [celest]
        * Some tidying up in battle_get_ functions [celest]
        * Set exp table and job bonus table to 0 before reading - might solve some
          memory bugs [celest]
        * Updated skill range leniency code - If possible try and move towards the
          skill target so that when casting it no longer falls out of range [celest]

01/15
        * Added effects to enemies for Gospel [celest]
        * Added mobs spawn to all Yuno fields (according to 4th Jan patch) [Lupus]

01/14
        * Added party supporting effects for Gospel [celest]

01/13
        * Added and testing support for 2004-12-06Sakexe [celest]
        * Removed emblem changing requiring Glory of Guild limited to TXT only [celest]
        * Corrected a typo preventing Plagiarism to work, thanks to orn [celest]
        * Fixed Berzebub card and other 'reduce cast delays' equipment not working
          [celest]
        * Updated packet_db.txt loading to support reading into multiple packet
          versions [celest]
        * Removed packet_db_ver defining in packet_db.txt -- it'll determine itself
          based on MAX_PACKET_VER [celest]
        * Integrated packet size and function DB's into 1 packet_db [celest]
        * Added MAX_PACKET_VER -- maximum versions supported by eA, including the
          packet_db -- and changed packet size and function DB's to use it [celest]
        * When sending 'Game exe not latest version' packet don't close the session 
          immediately so it will still be delivered [celest]
        * Added map-server display if an unidentified client was rejected --
          also fixes the 'empty string sent to _showmessage' [celest]
	* Added a bug - Celest, LOOK AT THIS BUG ASAP. [Codemaster]
        * Tided up/fixed some mobs [Lupus]

01/12
        * Implemented Vending Log [Lupus]
	  TODO: use log option to log only important deals (much money, rare items, etc)

01/11
        * Added Shinomori's changes to npc event timers (I never realised it, thanks
          ^^; ) [celest]
        * Updated clif.c to be able to identify client versions based on the packet DB
          [celest]
        * Correct packet_db_ver to the maximum version allowed if it was set too high 
          or too low in packet_db.txt [celest]
        * Added support for 2005-01-10Sakexe [celest]
        * Updated packet functions for 2004-11-08 and 2004-12-06 (Note: eA *can*
          support 12-06, but still doesn't recognise it... so unless we find a way,
          it is *not* supported yet) [celest]
        * Updated packet_db, thanks to Sara-chan [celest]
        * REMOVED support for clients before packet version 10 (2004-08-25 and 
          earlier) - the client will receive a 'Game Exe not latest version' message
          [celest]
        * Added a check to prevent crashing when trying to log in with
          2005-01-10aSakexe in servers that don't support it [celest]          
	* Added a fix to @sound where if you forgot the .wav exention, i'd attempt to play the file without it (it adds the .wav) [Codemaster] [SVN 949]
	* Added @disguiseall / @undisguiseall [Codemaster] [SVN 949]
	* Added misc. clif.c fixes (jAthena added alot of close(fd)'s, so i added them, too) [Codemaster] [SVN 949]
	* Added bug reports - Celest, you might want to check one of those out [Codemaster] [SVN 949]
        * Fixed a bug in clif.c which didn't allow to enther the map-server.
	  It worked under win32, but didn't under Linux. [Lupus]

01/10
        * Completed adding packet DB reading... still needs (a lot) more work in
          clif.c [celest]
        * Added Shinomori's suggestions for npc timers, thanks again ^^ [celest]
        * Removed checking for script event timers' length, and added Shinomori's
          changes [celest]
        * Start adding packet DB reading [celest]
        * Added 'max_eventtimer_length' (default is 32) to script_athena.conf. [celest]
          Some event timers with names longer than 24 could cause the server to close
          itself, change this if you need support for even longer names
        * Removed PCLoginEvent requiring 'PCLoginEvent' for the player to be set to 1
          first to be activated. [celest]
        * Added Shinomori and orn's fix for the skill tree to only check the first
          required skill in the DB and skipping the rest [celest]
        * Modified 'wedding' script command to work with "OnTimer" scripts even without
          doing 'attachnpctimer' (The 'player not attached' error will still display,
          but the effect will appear *over the NPC* instead of the player...
          at least it won't fail ^^) [celest]
        * Added 'attachnpctimer' script command for attaching the player to the current
          npc's timer in "OnTimerxxxx" scripts, thanks to Wallex for the idea. [celest]
          Syntax:
                 attachnpctimer;
                 attachnpctimer "<Player Name">;

          Check /npc/sample/npc_test_npctimer2.txt for example.
        * Added 'detachnpctimer' script command for detaching players from the npc's
          timer. [celest] Syntax:
                 detachnpctimer;
                 detachnpctimer "<NPC Name">;

	* Added 'OnInterIfInitOnce' for WoE scripts & modified the WoE scripts as well [Ajarn & Codemaster] [Thanks to FREYA] [SVN 943]
	* Added the @sound command and the NPC command of soundeffectall
	 - works just like soundeffect, but plays for everyone in the area [Codemaster] [SVN 942]
	* Don't allow Pets to attack Guardians outside of WoE [Codemaster] [SVN 940]
	* Require 15% of HP or more for WE_MALE skill [Codemaster] [SVN 940]
	* Require 15% of SP or more for WE_FEMALE skill [Codemaster] [SVN 940]

01/07
        * Upon changing to high novice 100 stat points should be given, not 88 [celest]
        * Give high novices First Aid and Trick Dead upon job changing [celest]
        * Remove some unnecessary checks in battle.c [celest]
        * Added some checks to prevent novices still allowed to attack when using
          Trick Dead [celest]
        * Added 'summon' script command. Syntax:

          	summon <monster name>,<monster id>[,<event>];

          Example: 'summon "Poring", 1002, "OnPoringKilled"; 'will summon (note:
                   not *spawn*) 1 poring that'll help its master for 1 minute,
                   and activate the "OnPoringKilled" event when killed.
                   'summon "--ja--",-1;' will summon a random monster.

        * Added Wallex's fix for the wedding script functions [celest]
        * Added the below-mentioned alive packet to SQL's char and login [celest]
        * Enabled login server 'anti-freeze' by default as a temporary solution
          to char-login disconnection [celest]
        * The TXT char server was rejecting login's "i'm alive" packet and disconnecting
          it... fixed [celest]
        * Stall_time wasn't being read in login_athena at all (not by the login server,
          because the code didn't read it, nor by TXT map server, since its in the SQL
          inter_athena.conf reading)... so moved it to inter_athena.conf, and
          change sql_config_read in map.c to inter_config_read [celest]
        * Some tidying up of battle_get_def and _def2 [celest]
        * Added 'bDelayrate' and changed Phen card, Marduk Card and Berzebub Card's
          effects to use this instead of bCastrate (which was reducing casting time,
          not delay time) [celest]
        * Some tidying up of skill_castfix and skill_delayfix [celest]
        * Added Filougarou's fix for Bowling Bash causing it to only display damage, 
          but doesn't do any - thanks! [celest]
        * Set delay_dependon_dex in battle_athena to 'no' by default [celest]

          Note: Just to clarify things, on official servers dex is not supposed to 
                reduce skill delays, only Poem of Bragi and Berzebub card does!

        * Fixed typo in skill_delayfix - reduce delays only if delaynodex was *not* set,
          sorry ^^; [celest]

01/06
	* Fixed various memory corruptions causing crashes (SVN 925) [MouseJstr]
	* Fixed typo in src/map/map.c causing compile 
	  errors (SVN 924) [MouseJstr]
	* Removed the alive_timer mechanism entirly replaced with
	  a stall detection mechanism that will disconnect a player
	  who has not sent any data for a configurable 
	  (conf/login_athena.conf:stall_time) amount of time.  The default
	  is currently 60 seconds.

	  The root cause of the disconnect error is that some NAT based
	  routers are not dropping the TCP connection when the aliased
	  machine goes offline abnormally.   This means that we are seeing
	  a stalled but perfectly valid TCP connection.

	  (SVN 924) [MouseJstr]
01/05
	* Fixed some typos in map_versionscreen() [MC Cameri]
	* Removed loop freeing in map-server's do_final(), it was causing seg faults [MC Cameri]

        * If a vending item was priced at 0 it'll be auto changed to 1million [celest]
        * Fixed TXT logging - log_athena.conf reading was kind of messed up [celest]
        * Added a simplified version of Qamera's OnConnect: OnDisconnect: OnDeath: 
          NPC events mod, (All credits go to him.) except adapted based on eA's current
          PCLoginEvent. (by davidsiaw) [celest]
          - Currently only 4 events have been added: PCDieEvent, PCKillEvent, 
            PCLogoutEvent and PCLoginEvent
          - For notes and usage example check /npc/sample/PCLoginEvent.txt (by
            davidsiaw)
          - To enable them for a player in a script, do
            "set <name of event>, <0 or 1>;"
            (yes it's saved in a permanent character variable and auto read every time)
          - Simply put, if any of them is set to 1 the appropiate event will activate
          p.s - Scripters who are already using PcLoginEvent, you'll need to add a
                "set PCLoginEvent, 1;" now, sorry for the trouble.

        * Optimised PCLoginEvent activation a bit [celest]
        * Set 'droprate0item''s default to 'yes' so that items with 0 rate will never
          drop [celest]
        * Look at item type other than item ID as well to check whether it is a card
          in card-related script commands - better support for custom items [celest]
        * Reset all skill variables if the skill fails so certain skills can't be
          abused (such as Warp, thanks to Alex14 for pointing it out) [celest]
        * Added /mapflag/noreturn.txt for disabling butterfly wings (not fly wings)
          [celest]
        * Fixed skill_require_db reading somehow getting corrupted if weapons usable
          for the skill is more than 20, thus causing the skills to fail everytime 
          [celest]
        * Fixed @killmonster crashing the server with summoned monsters, thanks to 
          Alex14 [celest]
        * Added double_connection_system to battle_athena (not completed yet) [celest]

01/04

        * Reduced MAX_SKILL_LEVEL to 10 to save a bit of memory and speed [celest]
        * Tidied up parts in skill_castfix a bit (SVN 895) [celest]
        * Fixed map-server crashing if an empty line was added in any of the skill-xx
          db files  (SVN 895) [celest]
        * Updated skill_castnodex reading - An *optional* 3rd value can be added to set
          whether a skill's delay time can be affected by dex  (SVN 895) [celest]
          Example: 46,1,1 - double strafe's delay is not affected by dex
                   46,1,0:0:0:0:1 - only level 5 double strafe is not affected by dex
	* More atempts at memory leak fixes [Codemaster] [SVN 890]
        * Updated weapon breaking rates, thanks to DracoRPG  (SVN 891) [celest]

        * Updated Soul Breaker's damage calculation [celest]
        * Updated Meteor Assault's cast delay to be not affected by dex [celest]
        * Changed int_guild.c so it will calculate average guild level only if > 0
          members are found - prevent divide by zero crashes (why would an empty guild
          be requested to update its' member info in the first place?) [celest]
        * Added Shinomori's fixes for string copying in script.c [celest]
	* Removed @giveitem since #item it's the one that does this and added some of it's support to #item [MC Cameri]
	  -#item <item_name> <item_count> <charname|all|everyone>
	* Uncommented out import in charcommand_athena.conf, there is
          need to have it commented (all the others ones are

	* don't delete alive_timers of -1  (SVN 823) [MouseJstr]
	* switched malloc,calloc,realloc to aMalloc, aCalloc, aRealloc

        * Corrected wrong logging of text in int_guild.c, thanks to Alex14 [celest]
        * Summoned monsters will not give exp and items [celest]
        * Added the 6 new Yuno fields to maps_athena.conf [celest]
        * Added some Freya's optimisations in clif_parse [celest]
        * Added clif_update_mobhp - monsters' hp viewing now updates properly [celest]
        * Set alive_timer to -1 when quitting, not 0, or the map server might assume
          its still active [celest]
	* Changed the *_override_grffile to no by default, because many were having issues with it [Ajarn]

12/26
	* Fixed ANOTHER pet crash (double free) (SVN: 804) [MouseJstr]
        * Added a proper #define for MAX_VENDING (SVN: 802) [MouseJstr]

	  inconsistancies.. [MouseJstr]  (SVN 793)
	* Some cleanup of spiritball memory management [MouseJstr] 
	* Dramatic performance work for exp updates to sql.  Previously, [MouseJstr]
	  when u killed a mob (in party share), it would cause the char_server to 

	  	1) Delete all guilds for all members of your party
	  	2) Re-create all guilds for all members of your party with the new exp
	     		values.

          Now it just generates 2 sql statements per party member,  

		1) update the guild exp, 
		2) update the guild_member exp.

		src/map/map.c src/map/chrif.c

        * Disabled import charcommand_conf.txt by default [celest]
        * Added Bitmap File system from jA 1086 - automatically generates a cache
          from maps in the GRF to speed up loading. You can enable/disable it with
          read_map_from_bitmap in map_athena.conf. Note: AFM maps will override this
          cache [celest]
        * Added --run_once flag for the map server for testing purposes - closes itself
          when everything is done loading [celest]
        * Added some code for Moonlit Petals and Basilica [celest]

12/24
        * Added suggested fix when client disconnected [celest]
          - send "disconnected due to time gap" and close session when timed out
          - send "server still recognises last login" message and close existing
            session when client reconnects
	* Upped windwalk to lv 10 in skill_tree [MouseJstr]
	* Fixed a scripting crash (SVN: 781) [MouseJstr]
	* removed @changesex and @charchangesex until we can

          in battle_athena.conf [celest]
        * Added a special NPC Logging command 'logmes'. It works as mes"Hello world!"; 
	  It is useful for such NPC as BANKS, CASINO, etc. To keep track of won money, etc.
	  Check kafra_bank.txt 1.1 for example.
		Note:	mes = otput into client's NPC window
			debugmes = output into map-server window
			logmes = output into lognpc log DB.

	  in 2 minutes [MouseJstr]
	* Fixed a bug in resnametable from local directories,
	  by fixing a bug in grfio_read causing memory corruptions [MouseJstr]
        * Rearranged how guild messages, gm messages, and party messages
          are moved back and forth between the inter server and the
          map server.. eliminating unneeded round trips to eliminate
          lag on a loaded char-server.  [MouseJstr]

          or deleting timers [celest]
        * Added sc_count check in skill_stop_dancing [celest]
        * Translated the japanese part in battle_athena.conf [celest]
        * Added ignore the new skill delays when chaining monk combos [celest]

12/21
	* Since conf/maps_list.txt was removed, added conf/maps_athena.conf [Ajarn]
	* Fixed a few NPCs that were giving curly errors. It seems to be caused by a bug that the NPCs' last line isn't read or something [Codemaster]
	* Fixed a tiny compile warning in npc.c [Codemaster]
	* Allowed the NPCs without proper curly brackets to still load, but give an error still [Codemaster]
	* Added variable 'current_file' which tells the filename of the script while loading npcs [MC Cameri]
	  -the variable its set in do_init_npc() or something like that, so you can only access it
	   after the use of do_init_npc().
	* Fixed the display of a warning saying that a right curly brace was missing [MC Cameri]
	* Removed @charwarp and @rura+ and added #warp, #rura, #rura+ [MC Cameri]

	  skill_tree.txt) [MouseJstr]
	* removed LK_SPIRALPIERCE from lord knights not on peco's[MouseJstr]
	* Moved the code from map_quit to pc_makesavestatus that
	  "adjusts" the skill tree before persisting to the character
	  server [MouseJstr]
	* made pc_makesavestatus() properly persist skills that are 
          unavailable but not forgotten (example, spiral pierce).  You can now
	  get spiral pierce,  get off your peco, log out, log in, and
	  get back on your peco and still have not lost the skill
	  points you invested.  This also solves the problems of when
	  the skill tree gets changed, players loosing the points. [MouseJstr]
	* Made pc_resetskill() properly reset skills that are
          currently not visible due to skilltree changes [MouseJstr]

          (-removed-) [celest]
        * Adapted skill_range_leniency to jA's code - should be more stable [celest]
        * Fixed drop rates only limited to multiples of 100's - thanks to jathena
          for pointing it out [celest]
        * Added missing code for castle_defense_rate [celest]
        * Removed pc_undead_nofreeze - no code for it [celest]
        * Updated unrefineable items table - thanks to jathena [celest]
        * Added 3 new script commands: [celest]
          - skilleffect : shows a skill effect on the player
          - doskill/skilluseid (originally by Qamera) : casts a skill on the player
          - skillusepos : casts a skill on a position
        * Added SC_SpeedUp0 [celest]
        * Merged itemdb_read for SQL and TXT [celest]

            src\common\nullpo.h src\common\timer.c src\common\db.c

                src\char_sql\char.c src\char\char.c src\map\map.c
	* Made it compile under gcc 2.95 [MouseJstr]
	* made the char and map servers auto-configure their own IP's
	  whenever possible [MouseJstr]

	  If you do not specify the server IP address, it now determines it
	  on its own.  This means that to get a server running that is
	  accessable from the internet you should only need to specify the
	  location of the data.grf files.  This eliminates one more point
	  of misconfiguration.

	  It does not correctly auto-configure for when you are behind a 
	  router or a firewall since there is no way of determining the 
	  external IP address.  On the other hand, we should be able to 
	  eliminate the lan_conf file since we know our IP addresses as well 
	  as our netmask.

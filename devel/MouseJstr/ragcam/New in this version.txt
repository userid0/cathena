I'd like to point out several changes in this version.

1. The app now reads from RAGCAM.ARG instead of RSMVIEW.ARG
2. The format for RAGCAM.ARG is as follows:

   <Path containing data.grf>  
   <Path within data.grf and filename of object to be viewed>

   for example:

   C:\Program Files\RagnarokOffline3\
   data\alb2trea.rsw

   Will load the data.grf file in the path "C:\Program Files\RagnarokOffline3\"
   and will load the object "data\alb2trea.rsw" from the grf file 

   This is because RagCam now reads directly from the data.grf file, so the old
   method of requiring the absolute path is unnecessary.

   RagCam can still read from folders, it just needs a bit of tweaking here and there.

3. Press F1 to get onscreen help.

4. You need to press SPACE first to get the camera moving.  This toggles mouse capture.
   No more annoying mouse capture difficulties!

5. Click on objects to select them either in Cam mode or select mode.
   While in Cam mode the first hit object in the red target box will be selected.
   
   Since this requires a redraw of the scene there may be a noticeable pause on low end systems.
   (Such as my PIII 700 / Geforce2 MX 32MB :P)

6. Pressing TAB toggles Info and Map overlays.

7. Press 1 2 or 3 to select Translation, Rotation or Scaling edit modes.

   U/J will affect the X value of the selected mode.
   I/K will affect the X value of the selected mode.
   O/L will affect the X value of the selected mode.

   [/] (square brackets) changes the model of the currently selected object.

8. Pressing F4 will save the edited RSW file.
  
   if the file is alberta.rsw, the saved file will be named alberta-new.rsw


I apologize for the lateness of this source code release.


Use in good health,


Ender

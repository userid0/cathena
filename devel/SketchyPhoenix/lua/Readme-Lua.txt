[ What is this? ]
This development branch of eAthena uses Lua 5.1 as a scripting language, using some
old code I found in DracoRPG / Kevin's files as a base.

It is not complete, but you knew that already didn't you?

[ How do I compile? ]
Only the eAthena-9 project is set up for lua since I did this all on windows.
You will have to include lua in your makefiles for *nix. One day I'll make makefiles... but am lazy.

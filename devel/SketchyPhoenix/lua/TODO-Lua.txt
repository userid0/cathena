TODO:
	*Merge the special lua functions into their counterpart functions.
		I started with different functions thinking that I would eventually
		remove the old script engine piece by piece. I later changed my mind
		and decided to allow the server to load eascript and lua with the user
		being able to use whatever they want.

	*Cleaning up afterwards.

	*Finish all these blasted buildin functions. There's like a million of these :(

	*SCRIPT DOCUMENTATION!

//Note 2: All rates are in percents, 100 would mean 100%, 200
//   would mean 200%, etc
//Note 3: Value is not limited to 60K (see below)
// Other Information:
// All options are limited to a max of 60K (aprox) which is 600%

// MVP bonus exp rate. (Note 2) (Note 3)
mvp_exp_rate: 100

// The rate of exp. that is gained by the process of resurrection, a unit is 0.01%.

// The rate of job exp. when using discount and overcharge on an NPC
// (in 0.01% increments - 100 is 1%, 10000 is normal, 20000 is double.)
// The way it is calculated is (money recieved * skill lv) * shop_exp / 10000.

use_statpoint_table: yes

// Maximum levels. The actual maximum level you can acquire is the minimum between the max 
// defined by the experience table and these values.
// If a character has a level higher than this maximum, it will not be reverted, it just won't
// be able to get any more levels.
// The @/# and script commands to level up will be capped by these max, not by the exp table's.

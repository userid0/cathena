// All options are limited to a max of 60K (aprox) which is 600%

// If someone loots, show name in party? (Note 1)
show_steal_in_same_party: no

// When 'Party Share' item sharing is enabled in a party, 
// tell the picker which party-member received the item? (Note 1)
show_party_share_picker: no

// Method of distribution when item party share is enabled in a party:
// 0: Random (item goes to a random party member)
// 1: Round Robin (items are distributed evenly and in order among members)
party_item_share_type: 0

// Is exp sharing disabled for idle members in the party?
// Set to no, or the amount of seconds (NOT milliseconds) that need to pass before considering
// a character idle.
// Characters sitting/in a chat are always considered idle.
// A character's idle status is reset upon item use/skill use/attack (auto attack counts too)/movement.
idle_no_share: no

// Use the alternate experience even share bonus equation?
// When multiple characters even share experience within a party, there's an experience bonus of 10% per additional teammate.
// Setting this to other than 0 uses a different experience bonus equation of the form: bonus*c*(c-1)/10 (where c is the total
// count of players to share experience). With bonus = 25 in a full party (c = 12) the total bonus is +25*12*11/10 = +330%,
// which means the total exp gained is 430% of the original, and each party member receives ~35% of the original mob's experience.
party_even_share_bonus: 0

// If a party uses a skill with penalties do they apply? (Note 1)
party_skill_penalty: yes

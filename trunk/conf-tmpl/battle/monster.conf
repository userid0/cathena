//Note 1: Directives can be set using on/off, yes/no or 1/0.
//Note 2: All rates are in percents, 100 would mean 100%, 200
//   would mean 200%, etc
//Note 3: Value is not limited to 60K (see below)
// Other Information:
// All options are limited to a max of 60K (aprox) which is 600%
// or 60secs as appropiate.
// 1000 miliseconds is 1 second.

// Enemy's Critical Rate (use 0 to disable non-skill criticals) (Note 2)

enemy_str: yes

// Can enemies have perfect flee? (Note 1)
enemy_perfect_flee: no

// [MVP] Summoned monsters HP rate, that is, monsters summoned by an MVP will have this much HP. (Note 2)

monster_hp_rate: 100

// The maximum attack speed of a monster
monster_max_aspd: 199

// Defines various mob AI related settings. The mask bits are (add to include multiple settings)
// 1: If disabled, mobs use Aegis-type path searching, that is, they only move on straight
//    lines, and will only change their destination tile after arriving to the previous one.
//    When enabled mobs use more dynamic and complex path searching to chase a player 
//    (they still must be within line of sight to start chasing)
// 2: Makes mob use their "rude attack" skill (usually warping away) if they are attacked and they
//    can't attack back regardless of how they were attacked (eg: GrimTooth), otherwise, their 
//    rude attack" is only activated if they can't melee reach the target (eg: sniping)
// 4: If not set, mobs that can change target only do so when melee attacked (distance player/mob < 3),
//    otherwise mobs may change target and chase ranged attackers.
// 8: If set, when a mob loses track of their target, they stop walking inmediately. Otherwise, they continue
//    to their last target tile. When set mobs also scatter as soon as they lose their target. Use this mode to 
//    make it much harder to mob-train by hiding and collecting them on a single spot (ie: GrimTooth training)

// Looting monster actions.
// 0 = Monster will consume the item.
// 1 = Monster will not consume the item.

// Chance of mob casting a skill (Note 2)
// Higher rates lead to 100% mob skill usage with no/few normal attacks.
// Set to 0 to disable mob skills.
mob_skill_rate: 100

// Mob skill delay adjust (Note 2)
// After a mob has casted a skill, there is a delay before being able to

boss_spawn_rate: 100

// Should mobs not spawn within the viewing range of players?
// 0 is disabled, otherwise it is the number of retries before giving up

// Whether mobs should change target temporarily when a skill triggers a counter mob skill (Note 1)
// eg: Mob attacks player B, and player A casts a skill C. If set to yes and the

// the skill, otherwise B will be targetted by the reaction skill.

// Monsters level up (monster will level up each time a player is killed and they will grow stronger)

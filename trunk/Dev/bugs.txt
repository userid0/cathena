Reported Bug: It seems cards (somehow) aren't working properly. For instance, 
		the doppelganger card does not stack properly anymore (although 
		I think that might be a "fix") and previously I created a 
		custom card that added 255 to all stats (after checking if the 
		person was a GM) and this card, as well, has problems: I used 
		to be able to do 999999 damage with Jupital Thunder and now it 
		does approximaetly 19000 (perhaps this, too, is a stacking 
		problem).

Hello, welcome to the /builds/ folder. ^_^

This contains seemingly random builds of the SVN, as well as 
the source from that era.

The higher the number, the newer the version. Builds found to
be highly unstable will be removed, less used builds may also
be removed. Download and test whatever you want, feedback on
the builds themsevles goes to Ancyker (not bugs!).

To use the builds you need to download the following:

For All Versions:
 source.tar.gz (REQUIRED)

For TXT:
 login-server.tar.gz (REQUIRED)
 char-server.tar.gz (REQUIRED)

- NOTE: Use this file to place BIG BAD BUGS that have been going on for a good
  while and it seems noone can fix them (Use the forums for common everyday
  bugs). Bugs in this file are not meant to be "fixed" as much as they are a
  "reminder" of big bugs that have not been fixed yet. An good example would
  be "the matrix bug" from the good old days.

BUG: grf loading is broken.
DESC: Specifying multiple grfs is badly broken, as the 'checksum' applied to
files usually returns the wrong index, thus looking the file up on the wrong
grf file. Users have also reported that reading from the data/ dir is messed
up. See link for all details.

BUG: @reloadscript causes a crash
DESC: Do a @reloadscript, and it will inmediately crash on the
skill_unit_timer function. Apparently the global objects array gets messed up
when cleaning the npcs. Valgrind doesn't seems to point at any particular
cause. I suspect it may have to do with NPC shops.

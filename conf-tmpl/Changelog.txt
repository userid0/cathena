Date	Added
2006/08/08
	* Removed config settings display_delay_skill_fail and
	  display_snatcher_skill_fail, replaced them with display_skill_fail, which
	  can be used to determine whether you hide ALL skill-failed messages, those
	  from delay, those from Snatcher or those from Envenom (battle/skill.conf)
	  [Skotlex]
2006/08/07
	* Added config force_random_spawn which overrides the spawn-files defined
	  coordinates to make all mobs always spawn randomly on the map. [Skotlex]
	* SC_SPEEDUP0 is no longer dispellable by SA_DISPEL [Skotlex]
2006/08/04
	* Removed settings enemy_critical_rate, homun_critical_rate. Added settings
	  enable_critical (defaults to specify only players), mob_critical_rate and
	  critical_rate. The last applies to all non-mobs and non-players
	  (battle/battle.conf) [Skotlex]
	* Removed settings mob_npc_warp, mob_warpportal. Replaced with setting
	  mob_warp which specifies which types of warp can a mob step into
	  (battle/monster.conf) [Skotlex]
	* Changed name of the setting log_pick to log_filter since that's what it
	  does now. [Skotlex]
	* Modified enable_logs so that instead of a 0/1 setting, you can specify
	  which kind of events to log (so you can use a combination), see log_athena
	  for the bitmask configuration. [Skotlex]
	* Cleaned a bit the contents of log_athena.conf
2006/08/02
	* Updated status_cast_cancel to also include silence (so the cast bar is
	  cancelled if you are silenced during it) [Skotlex]
2006/08/01
	* merged in atcommands jailfor, jailtime, charjailtime. Thanks to Meruru
	  and Coltaro for the code. [Skotlex]
	* Expanded setting debuff_on_logout so that &1 removes negative buffs and
	  &2 removes positive buffs. [Skotlex]
	* Added battle config file status.conf, moved some settings from skill.conf
	  and battle.conf to it since they are entirely Status-Change related.
	  [Skotlex]
2006/07/27
	* Added config setting party_update_interval so you can specify how often
	  the party-mate minidots should be updated (defaults to 1 sec). [Skotlex]
	* Removed a bunch of broken comments in skill.c [Skotlex]

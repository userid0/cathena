	* Began the real work [DracoRPG]
	  - Added missing "-lualib" flag to Makefile, thanks again celest
	  - Deleted npc folder, we'll now use script instead
	  - Now script_main.lua is loaded instead of old script_xx.conf files, script files will
	    be loaded from script_main.lua via Lua's require() function
	  - Added a primitive run_function() to run Lua functions, no support for args/result atm
	  - Added @runlua atcommand for testing, try @runlua test and check map-server window ;)

06/24
	* Rewrote npcnext, npcclose, npcinput and npcmenu (can't do npcshop... it's 2:30AM lol),
	  sorry Kevin but you know I like rewriting your work ^^ : now they use only one buildin
	  function and no more Lua function to call them indirectly [DracoRPG]
	 --> Some bits of the 'old' code still remain (e.g. the RUNNING state or npc_scriptnext)
	     to allow compilation since I did not rewrite npcshop yet but I'll remove'em quick ;)
06/18
	* Added npcshop function Usage: [Kevin]
	 npcshop(itemid, price, itempid2, price2, ...)
	* npcinput now works, use 0 for number input and 1 for string input. [Kevin]
	* Changed npcmenu function just a little, doesn't affect how it is used. [Kevin]
	* Changed char_id to a global lua thing, so you don't have to use id ever time. [Kevin]
	* Changed the way menus work, no need to call two different functions now ^^; [Kevin]
	* Some reorganizing in scripts, some Payon warps weren't properly converted to Lua style,
	  I commented them out for the moment. Except those ones, warps work perfectly! [DracoRPG]
06/12
	* Fixed areascripts running everytime you walk, now only runs when you go into an area. [Kevin]
	* Menu functions work, Usage: [Kevin]
	 npcmenu(id, "menuitem", 1, "menuitem2", 2)
	 local c = npcmenu_getchoice(id)
       --c contains the return value for the menu item selected, the return value must be an int.
	* Added advanced script state system, lua branch should now be functional, just needs [Kevin]
	 commands and scripts in terms of NPCs, not sure about mob spawns or chunks.
	* Added all warps currently possible [Fredzilla]
06/10
	* Added vary simple script state, and added npcclose2 and npcend. [Kevin]
	* Added a functional Niflheim variant of the Healer Dog, using areascript... try to get
	  close to him ;) Atm the function is triggered every time you do a step in the area,
	  I will fix it [DracoRPG]
	* Added npcmes and fixed some compile errors, there is some kind of status access
	  violation error in the map server, needs fixin =)[Kevin]
	* Major modifications [DracoRPG]
	  - Entirely rewrote how NPCs/area scripts/warps are managed, now they are really
	  different objects (different data struct, different block list types, etc)
	  - Added buildin functions addnpc, addareascript and addwarp
	  - It compiles with warnings, and those functions crash the map-server, I know! :p
06/06
	* Added untested addnpc build-in function, rearranged code here and there [DracoRPG]
	* Rewrote most of functions, now script_run_chunk works and script_run_function can take
	  any number of arguments (types specified with a "format" string)... but beware, Lua
	  API's stack is limited to 20 items! [DracoRPG]

06/05
	* Added script_buildin_commands, and a buildin system to add custom commands : registers
	  commands, but not sure how to make the work with runlua, it succeeds with lua, but
	  guessing it's problem with @runlua or maybe my C function 'test' is just wrong ;-)
	  --> or maybe the function is already defined in Lua: check 'sample\test.lua' [DracoRPG]
	* PC[Login|Logout|Kill|Die]Event are now working with Lua functions, same should be for
	  mobs' death events (untested though) [DracoRPG]
	* Now there are script_run_function() and script_run_function_nochar available [DracoRPG]

06/04
	* Began the real work [DracoRPG]
	  - Added missing "-lualib" flag to Makefile, thanks again celest
	  - Deleted npc folder, we'll now use script instead
	  - Now script_main.lua is loaded instead of old script_xx.conf files, script files will
	    be loaded from script_main.lua via Lua's require() function
	  - Added a primitive run_function() to run Lua functions, no support for args/result atm
	  - Added @runlua atcommand for testing, try @runlua test and check map-server window ;)

06/03

	* Added ideas for LUA use [DracoRPG]
	* Added Lua lib to makefile [celest]

06/01

	* Added script_buildin_commands, and a buildin system to add custom commands,
	  registers commands, but not sure how to make the work with runlua, it succeeds with lua, but
	  guessing its problem with @runlua or maybe my C function 'test' is just wrong ;-).
	* PC[Login|Logout|Kill|Die]Event are now working with Lua functions, same should be for
	  mobs' death events (untested though) [DracoRPG]
	* Now there are script_run_function() and script_run_function_nochar available ^^ [DracoRPG]

	* Began the real work [DracoRPG]
	  - Added missing "-lualib" flag to Makefile, thanks again celest
	  - Deleted npc folder, we'll now use script instead
	  - Now script_main.lua is loaded instead of old script_xx.conf files, script files will
	    be loaded from script_main.lua via Lua's require() function
	  - Added a primitive run_function() to run Lua functions, no support for args/result atm
	  - Added @runlua atcommand for testing, try @runlua test and check map-server window ;)

I thought it isnt really required but I would be nice to have this, just to keep a log really ;)

Problem:	Cant move after using a shop
Assigned:	N/A
Progess:	0%
Note:		Only happens when you dont buy anything, and just cancel it
		You need to log out and back to move again, the map servr give this error
		Cannot run PCLogoutEvent for player "num": player is already running a script

Problem:	Shop dont read the price from item_db.txt
Assigned:	N/A
Progess:	0%
Note:		When you use -1, it has the price of -1

Problem:	Doesnt seem to matter about last numbers in Map Warp
Assigned:	N/A
Progess:	0%
Note:		I even raised it to 15x15 and there was no change, seem to be set on 2x2 (guess)
		no matter what it says inside the file, this could be bad for warps that do
		need bigger range

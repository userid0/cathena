This is the production branch of eAthena used at www.clownphobia.com.
It was splitt off from stable at revision 1887, so lacks namy of the 
features that have prevented "stable" from living up to its name. 
(including, unfortunately, Taekwon) But is capable of 24hour+ uptimes 
with userloads of up to 1000.

The most important change is the login-server, which is customized to 
read its accounts from an Invision Power Board accounts table, allowing 
additional security (IPB uses one-way password encryption) and 
server-forum inegration.

This branch is SQL-Only, text databases not supported.

//<Skill id>,<Cast: 1 or 0>,<Delay (Optional): 1 or 0>,<Walk Delay(Optional): 1 or 0>
// Cast: With 1, dex does not affect the skill's cast rate
// Cast: With 0, dex affects the skill's cast rate
// Delay: With 1, dex does not affect the skill's delay rate
// Delay: With 0, dex affects the skill's delay rate
// Walk Delay: With 1, characters can't move while the skill's delay is active.
// Walk Delay: With 0, characters can move as soon as the spell finishes casting.
// Example - 46,1,1 = Double Strafe's casting time and delay is not affected by dex.
// By default, dex NEVER affects after-cast delay, so no need of putting 'x,0,1' in this file

16: Cast Sensor: If mob is aggressive, it will also change targets while chasing/following someone else, otherwise, it'll also be cast-sensitive while idle/random-walking.
32: Boss. Special flag which makes mobs inmune to certain stuff like status-changes and basilica.
64: Plant. Always receives 1 damage from stuff.
128: Can Attack. Everyone with a few exceptions has this. Only prevents normal attacks, not skills.
256: Detector: can see hidden players. Insects, Demons, and Bosses automatically receive this.
512: Change Target: Can change targets while this mob is MELEE attacking. Only aggressive mobs can change targets while chasing/following.
1024: ChangeChase: When the mob is chasing a player and it passes nearby another player, it will switch targets and hit this other player. Note this only applies if the new player is withing attack range, it won't change it's chase-path to another player!
2048: Berserk: These mobs are "hyper-active". They will change to the closest player while they are following up, They also have skill states "follow" and "angry" (instead of "chase"/"attack") when they pick a new target by their own (ie: not when they change targets due to being attacked)

	  monsters.
	* Added Reddozen's work for Hunter's Beast bane spirit bonus. [Skotlex]

	  previously were assumed to not fail. May help figure out what's going on

	* Reviewed and cleaned up a bit the latest SG additions from Komurka. [Skotlex]
	- My skill desc says that SG_DEVIL does not makes you blind until you reach

	  - To activate, enable 'exchndl' in plugin_athena.conf

		plugins if you can ('exchndl' for Win32, 'sig' for cygwin and linux) and send in any

	  different from 1 (1 = No damage skill) [Skotlex]
	* Various cleanups to the char-sql server to prevent corner-case crashes
	  from queries that return no rows. [Skotlex]
	* Massive Taekwon Boy skills related code cleanup. [Skotlex]
	- Flying Side kick and Turn Kick should be fully working now, too.

	* Corrected Grimtooth counting a short-range skill when it's actually
	  ranged. [Skotlex]

	  divided by number of targets (sort of, skill % dmg is adjusted according
	  number of targets) [Skotlex]
	* Tarot Card of Fate won't break equipment now if equip_skill_break_rate is
	  0. [Skotlex]
	* Improvements and optimizations to the online db management in the char
	  txt/sql servers. [Skotlex]
	* Updated the guild cache (char sql) to have it load/unload characters
	  whenever they are updated in the char online_db (previously they were only
	  updated on normal char-select/char-quit when there were more cases where a

	  in the same direction they were walking when interrupted. [Skotlex]

2005/11/29
	* Fixed race exp bonuses. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed ## account variable saving disconnecting the char-login servers. [Skotlex]

	* Fixed Restore requiring Regeneration lv2 [Skotlex]
	* Fixed the spirit sphere bonus not applying to Throw Spirit Sphere. [Skotlex]

	  - Now when you in duel, you can't attack anything out of your duel
	    (mobs, other players etc...);
	  - Now you can't take part in duel more often than it set in battle_athena.
	    Default delay is 60 minutes.
	  - New battle_athena.conf options: duel_allow_pvp - allow/disallow duel
	    on pvp-maps; duel_allow_gvg - allow/disallow duel on gvg-maps;
	    duel_time_interval - delay between using duel in minutes.

	  so use with caution! [Skotlex]
	* Fixed a pair of exp exploits possible with to Rich Man Kim and
	  race-add-exp card bonuses. [Skotlex]
	* Updated behaviour of skillrange_from_weapon. If set, those skills with
	  negative range use the weapon's range. If not set, then the skill range
	  used is the absolute value of the range specified in the skill_db. [Skotlex]
	* Small cleanup of the color broadcast packet using data provided by Master
	  of Muppets. It should hopefully fix the font-size on said colored messages.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Fixed the setting of the guild id and guild emblem in packets 0x7b and
	  0x78 for mobs/npcs (this is assuming the position is correct when filling
	  these same packets for players) [Skotlex]
	* Added battle_config option skillrange_from_weapon which, when set, allows
	  weapon based, target-selected, offensive skills to take the equipped
	  weapon's range instead of the range defined in the skill_db. [Skotlex]
	* WARNING/ACHTUNG! Update all your NPCs ASAP. Massive NPC fix's out. [Lupus]
	* Updated monster_ai&8 so that mobs scatter as soon as they lose their
	  target. Use this setting for an effective counter measure to Grimtooth
	  mass-mob training. [Skotlex]
	* Added pc_damage_walk_delay_rate to separate the walk delay adjustment of
	  players from that of mobs. The adjustment for players is 20% while for mobs
	  is 100%, pending further adjustments. [Skotlex]
	* Added the weapon upgrade damage bonus of Spiral Pierce [Skotlex]
	* Removed the mob_stop_walking code from mob_damage as it should be invoked
	  on battle_walkdelay (the mob walk delay issue will likely need it's own
	  config option) [Skotlex]
	* Added joshuali's new Visual Studio files. [Lance]
	* Novice Warp Portal fixes from jAthena. [Lance]
	* Final warning elimination in plugins.c (most of them are gone with warning level set to 1). [Lance]
	* Fixed typo in msg_athena.conf and 'users with autoloot turned on will not have their rare drops announced.'. Thanks to Kaseki.
	* Mob should stop walking when hit if not enduring. Thanks to Playtester. [Lance]
	* Included pcre.dll and libmysql.dll from joshuali. [Lance]
	* Eliminated Level 3 warnings. Setting compile warnings to Level 3. (Level 4 just kills eAthena XD) [Lance]

	* Updated the damage code if Spiral Pierce, Shield Chain and Shield
	  boomerang to be closer to official. [Skotlex]

	  fixed that delete_timer mismatch on shutdown [Skotlex]
	* Autospells now won't trigger if the range between the source and the
	  target is not satisfied. [Skotlex]
2005/11/26
	* Added bonus2 bAddSkillBlown for adding a custom knockback value to a
	  skill. Note that this knockback bonus is ADDED to whatever the default
	  knockback of the skill is. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed Soul Linker skills showing up on the tree for leveling up. [Skotlex]
	* Probably fixed the crash in inter_guild_CharOffline [Skotlex]
	* Modified the skill get range routine to correctly account for the attack
	  range and the AC_VULTURE range bonus where needed. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed alchemists Fame Points bug: It were giving 1 fame point [Lupus]
		on making 4 Condensed Potions in row, instead of 3, etc. Now tested ^_-
	* Some restructuring and cleaning up in map loading to make it easier for
	  future plans (like removing Grfio) [celest]
	  - split map loading into separate sources properly
	  - added map server will display a list of enabled map sources on startup
	  - added maps will be auto-imported into the map cache if it's loaded with
	    AFM, AF2, or any other source
	  The server looks for maps in this descending order: the map cache, AFM maps,
	  AF2 maps, and finally GAT files from the GRF (slowest); so, if you enable map
	  caching it should be a liiiittle bit faster then before ^^
2005/11/25
	* Uploaded fixes to int_guild, tested and working safely. [Kevin]
	* Added @showzeny @ command. [Skotlex]
	* Some code cleanup to make AutoBerserk work the way it was intended to
	  (skill toggles "auto-berserk" state on/off, if on, you automatically get
	  Provoked when under 25%HP) [Skotlex]
	* Fixed Auto-Berserk auto-ending after a minute. [Skotlex]
	* Added a fix to mob skills to prevent them from being checked too
	  frequently during battle (which was sort of bumping up their rate to double
	  or more from what the skill db would state) [Skotlex]
	* Added cleaning up the fifo before sending the guild information (since
	  the packet is big, the fifo should be cleared to avoid overflow problems)
	  [Skotlex]
	* Added monster_ai&8, when set monsters stop walking as soon as they lose
	  their current target [Skotlex]
	* Reflect Sword again reflects damage versus players. [Skotlex]
	* Corrections to the skill code so only Heaven's Drive may damage traps. [Skotlex]
	* Reverted the mob random walk delay after unlocking a target to 3~6 secs. [Skotlex]
	* Added pow, sqrt and distance to scripting commands. [Lance]
	* Removed players with 0 Fame Points from Blacksmith/Alchem/Taekwon TOP10 lists [Lupus]
	* Should fix night glowing bug. [Lance]
	* Added setd and getd variable retrieving and setting with dynamic names. [Lance]
	* Added petstat command as requested by Dubby. [Lance]
2005/11/24
	* Fixed a small bug in the guild search by name routine. Should fix the
	  crash on new guild creation. [Skotlex]
	* Added debug information in case the guild isn't found in the cache when
	  it should be there. This should help fix any problems the guild cache
	  might have (eg: for some function that may take effect on a guild which
	  has no members online) [Skotlex]
	* Finished cleaning up and merging the guild cache withthe guild timers
	  behaviour. It should be mostly safe to update now. [Skotlex]
	* Reverted the sql save behaviour. [Skotlex]
	- Now guilds timers and cache are both into effect, this requires a bit
	  more of cleaning to be considered done.
	* Various things I made but already forgot xD [DracoRPG]
	* Fixed and updated damage bonus for forged weapons: VVVS is +40 (was previously +50
	  for the right hand...) and "famous maker bonus" gives a no-miss +10 dmg, same as
	  2 additional Star Crumbs. [DracoRPG]
	* Added or updated several Taekwon skills [DracoRPG]
	  - Jump Kick uses clif_slide to the target's exact pos , waiting for capture/video
	  - Taekwon ranking is now supported by the fame system, but there's no way to gain
	    points atm (Taekwon Mission has no effect), infinite kick combo should be OK
	  - 4 basic kicks updated, you now stop attacking when a stance triggers, and have 2
	    seconds to hit the button before attacking again
	  - Run uses SC_SPORT to increase your STR and affect the way Break Fall works
	  - Break Fall dodges ranged magic/weapon attacks, as well as melee weapon ones
	    when SC_SPORT is active
	* Made Sword Reject / Counter Instinct reflect damage only against monsters (not
	  100% sure about it, but let's say 90%... iRO site says it, although it isn't
	  the best source ever) [DracoRPG]
	* Made Spiral Pierce use SC_STOP instead of setting canwalk_tick, some other such things
	  need to be reviewed [DracoRPG]
	* Fixed Pneuma. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed dead mobs reappearing on the map. [Skotlex]
	* Cleaned up the duel code in battle_check_target. [Skotlex]
	* Added config option summons_inherit_effects, defaults to yes, check
	  battle_athena.conf for further details. [Skotlex]
	* Updated duel [LuzZza]
	- Now "@duel <Num>" may be used for indication max players limit of duel.
	- Now "@duel <Nick>" creating duel for two players and automatically send invitation to Nick.
	* Added a new script function: getequipcardid(equipSlot,CardSlot) [Lupus]
		Returns Card ID or just a value from your EQUIPPED item
		Useful to check equipped items PROPERTY, STRONG value, Author ID, etc
		Check npc\sample\getequipcardid.txt and read script.c comment ^_-
2005/11/23
	* Fixed the crash on guild creation in new guild cache. [Kevin]
	* Implemented duel organizing commands: @duel, @invite, @accept, @reject, @leave. [LuzZza]
	* Made the walk-delay a timer, so that it triggers after the actual attack
	  motion of the src. [Skotlex]
	* Added back the combo damage delay config, now renamed to
	  multihit_delay, and set to the default of 230ms it had before. [Skotlex]
	* Added displaying file which caused an error on incorrect mob lines.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Small memory corrections to sql castle saving/loading, mostly Lance's
	  work. [Skotlex]
	* Updated the walk delay routine to not invoke stop-walking when character
	  is not walking (fixes the case in which the packet is sent while sitting,
	  which causes a 'standing' sprite even if the char is sitting). [Skotlex]
2005/11/22
	* Implemented a guild cache in char sql, saves all online guilds every 5 minutes. [Kevin]
	* More grammar fixes [Kayla]
	* Added 1-tile of range grace in skill_use_id and skill_use_pos since
	  that's how it is on Aegis servers. [Skotlex]
	* Updated the skill info packets to deliver the skill names as expected by
	  the client. [Skotlex]
	* Updated mob ai to enable changing targets while attacking ONLY if the
	  attacker is within melee range (Aegis AI). monster_ai&4 can be used to
	  override this and allow mobs to change target and pursue ranged attackers.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Updated the config comments for the ip-related settings. Thanks to
	  akusarujin for the update. [Skotlex]
	* Added rates to at_command.conf, set it's default to GM lv1 [Skotlex]
	* Removed the icon from Fire Break's fire-elemental bonus. [Skotlex]
	* Updated the walkdelay function to only be invoked if the attack did
	  damage. [Skotlex]
	* Some more fixes to the english in ShowInfo()'s [Kayla]
	* Cleaned out the SVN a bit [Kayla]
2005/11/21
	* Removed "(now unlimited loop start!)" from char-sql in an info line...wtf xD..[Kayla]
	* Mob AI update: updated the conditions used to specify if a mob can change
	  targets as per the forum provided information (by Komurka and Kyoki).
	  Mode 512 (MD_CHANGETARGET) no longer does anything. [Skotlex]
	* Mobs that assist now link nearby mobs when they attack. [Skotlex]
	* Made the damage delay be applied after knockback rather than before
	  (magical/misc instant effect attacks are still applied before the
	  knockback) [Skotlex]
	* The damage delay timer now stores the distance between source/target, if
	  this distance is increased by 2 or more, the damage delay fails and takes
	  no effect (if the '2' needs to be made higher, do point it out. It
	  shouldn't be much of a problem since you aren't supposed to be able to walk
	  from the damage delay anyway). [Skotlex]
	* Changed the way damage delay works. It is no longer applied on
	  mob_damage/pc_damage, but instead is invoked from clif_damage (or
	  clif_skill_damage), which means the "can't walk" delay is sync'ed with the
	  damage packets when they are sent. This should fix most delay-damage
	  'stun-lock' related issues. [Skotlex]
2005/11/20
	* Mobs now can't move while casting. [Skotlex]
	* Updated mob_db.txt and mob_db.sql with the most recent data from Kyoki.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Corrected the mob_db by adding the canmove/canattack bits to pretty much
	  all mobs that needed them. [Skotlex]
	* Some fixes to the confusion code. [Skotlex]
	* Crash-fix in status_change_start [Skotlex]
	* Implemented confusion as it should be (not tested yet!) [Skotlex]
	* Updated run_script to backup the current script of a player and
	  restore it if the current script ends inmediately. This should fix losing
	  the script info if status_calc_pc is invoked while running a script.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Fixed a memory leak in the guild eliminate timer. [Skotlex]
	* Removed the extra tile of range mobs have when walking. [Skotlex]
	* Added mob reloading to battleconfig reload @ command. [Skotlex]
	* Updated mob_db.sql with the new modes by Kyoki. [Skotlex]
2005/11/19
	* Made characters stop walking when inflicted by SC_STOP, may fix
	  GrimTooth's stop effect not seeming to take effect. [Skotlex]
	* Made the pk_min_level config not take effect in WoE/GvG grounds.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Fixed showing falcon when player is hide. [LuzZza]
	* Updated mob_db.sql and item_db.sql to current [Skotlex]
	* Updated the skill db step guessing code to allow for negative ranges (Now
	  spear boomerang should progressively get longer range with higher levels)
	  [Skotlex]
	* Fixed Tarot Card, the card that gets two random effects can't retrigger
	  itself, and it causes STOP instead of Stun where appropiate. [Skotlex]
	* Updated devotion to only work on damage attacks that have a source (will
	  prevent it from "blocking" COMA, which is what caused the crash). [Skotlex]
	* Fixed not always showing CRIT attacks, thanks to Irmin [Lupus]
2005/11/18
	* Updated mob_ai so aggressive mobs change target when chasing, and
	  change-target mobs do so when attacking. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed weapon forging showing success even when it fails. [Skotlex]
	* Some cleaning up of @time, may fix the weird time displays. [Skotlex]
	* Modified mob_ai so hyper-active mobs change target if they are
	  cast-sensors even if attacking (angry mode). They will also change target
	  if attacked while in angry/follow mode regardless of their change-target
	  mode. [Skotlex]
	* Moved the night-inducing code from "map loaded ack" to "spawn pc", should
	  fix characters going ultra-blue after stuff like fly-wings. [Skotlex]
	* Delayed the mob emotion when doing skills so that it gets executed AFTER
	  the skill is successfully performed. [Skotlex]
	* Implemented PR_REDEMPTIO. Is the penalty for both base and job exp?
	  That's how it is currently. And if the map has the nopenalty flag,there's
	  no exp penalty. Awaiting further input on the matter (altough, do note the
	  skill isn't tested either) [Skotlex]
	* Fixed three memory issues (char txt shutdown, npc reloading, ore
	  discovery logs) which were pointed out by End of Exam. [Skotlex]
	* Added support for hyper-active mobs (MD_CHANGECHASE = 0x400), these mobs
	  will change to the closest target while chasing/following other players.
	  Needs be added to the mob_db. [Skotlex]
	* Added support for hyper-aggressive mobs (MD_BERSERK = 0x800), these mobs
	  change their skill state to angry/follow instead of attack/chase when they
	  select/change target (except if they changed target because the new target
	  attacked them). Needs be added to the mob_db, for now all aggressive mobs
	  are considered hyper as well. [Skotlex]
	* Updated mob mode cast-sensor (MD_CASTSENSOR = 0x010), mobs that are
	  Aggressive can also change target if they are chasing/following a player
	  when someone else casts a skill on them. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed Dark Blessing. [Skotlex]
	* Changed the default battle_delay_damage value from no to yes. [Skotlex]
	* Added check to prevent reinitiating SC_GOSPEL on a character that already
	  has GOSPEL and val4 == BCT_SELF, may fix multiple Gospels being placed on
	  the ground. [Skotlex]
2005/11/17
	* Altered behaviour of NPC_EMOTION/NPC_EMOTION_ON as requested by Komurka.
	  [Skotlex]
	- val[0] (the first one) is the emotion the mob does. If val[1] is
	  different from 0, then the mob's mode is changed to THIS value. If val[2]
	  is different from zero, it'll add/remove a mode based on skill used
	  (EMOTION_ON adds mode, EMOTION removes it), both can stack [Skotlex]
	* Fixed for sure the Makefile... [Skotlex]
	* Modified Wedding effects. That is, changing base to 22 does NOT displays
	  wedding outfit anymore. To display the wedding outfits, you have to start
	  SC_WEDDING instead. Tux/Wedding dress scripts likely need being updated.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Added battle option disp_zeny, will display on console how much zeny you
	  earned (be it from selling, trading, mobs, etc, as long as you "earned"
	  zeny) [Skotlex]
	* Updated status_calc_pc to prevent infinite recursion loops. [Skotlex]
	* Applied End of Exam's suggested signedness fixes to npc.c [Skotlex]
	* Updated sting lib, to avoid SQL troubles [Lupus]
	* Fixed moonlit not properly checking for nearby walls. [Skotlex]
	* Added a recursion protection system to status_calc_pc which should avoid
	  exploits derived from recursively calling status_calc_pc which certain
	  equipment scripts could trigger. Thanks to End of Exam for pointing it out.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Applied Celest's patch which should help compiling eA under mingwin.
	  [Skotlex]
2005/11/16
	* Fixed AFM map loading (something was missing there which was gonna make
	  the map server crash for sure later on) [Skotlex]
	* Some corrections to the mob states, linked/cast-sensitive mobs engage in
	  attach/chase modes, not angry/follow (which seem reserved entirely for
	  aggressive mobs) [Skotlex]
	* Cleaned up and corrected target types MSS_AROUND->MSS_AROUND8, also added
	  and documented them in mob_skill_db.txt [Skotlex]
	* Probably corrected whispers to GMs. Thanks to Slennox for pointing it
	  out. [Skotlex]
	* Modified mob-skill states to use Aegis-based information. Modes are
	  MSS_IDLE, MSS_WALK, MSS_LOOT, MSS_DEAD, MSS_BERSERK, MSS_ANGRY, MSS_RUSH
	  and MSS_FOLLOW. Mob skill db is unaltered other than for the fact it now
	  supports "angry" and "follow" states. [Skotlex]
	* Cleanup of how knockback routines are invoked. [Skotlex]
	* Added MOB_LAZYSKILLPERC to mob.c, determines probability of a mob doing a
	  skill when there are no players nearby (but there has to be players in the
	  same map for it to trigger). Currently set to 10/1000 chance. [Skotlex]
	* battle_check_target update. Rewrote the party/guild checks, this should
	  hopefully fix any problems left with pvp/gvg and mapflags not working
	  properly. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed playerattached() returning char id instead of account id. [Skotlex]
	* Added battle option party_even_share_bonus to enable use of Valaris's evn
	  share experience bonus equation rather than the official one. [Skotlex]
	* Corrected @jump not displaying the actual coords you jumped to. Thanks to
	  kitty74x9 for noticing (and fixing) it out. [Skotlex]
2005/11/15
	* Fixed multi-hitting skills not increasing the "can-walk" delay
	  accordingly. [Skotlex]
	* Modified way to updating hp/position of party members. [LuzZza]
	* Added battle config option "aura_lv", specifies which level characters
	  have to be for the server to report their level as "max_lv" (which normally
	  is used to enable the aura). See battle_athena.conf for more details. It
	  may not work for your self, but only for other characters (this is,
	  afterall, untested yet) [Skotlex]
	* Implemented High Jump (works 100%) and Fighting Chant (untested but should work). [DracoRPG]
	* Various cleanups and typo fixes here and there. [DracoRPG]
	* Corrected the upkeep SP cost of Moonlight Petals. [Skotlex]
	* Modified Magnum Break's fire bonus to be 20% ADDITIONAL fire damage of
	  your total damage previous to the elemental modifier. [Skotlex]
	* Modified Fatal Blow's stun chance to kRO's equation (+5% stun chance per
	  bash skill level over 5) [Skotlex]
	* Corrected Sharpshooting's damage equation to +50%*skill_lv [Skotlex]
	* Updated Magnum Break's bonus from 10% to 20% fire elemental. [Skotlex]
	* Updated Arrow Shower to be a ground based skill (untested yet) [Skotlex]
	* Pretty much rewrote how Moonlight Petals work, it should be working
	  mostly right now. [Skotlex]
	* Splitted gat map information into gat and cell info. gat info is
	  permanent map data (walls, ground, etc) while cell is temp map info
	  (basilica, pneuma, etc). Modified Pneuma and Moonlight Petals to work based
	  on map cells. [Skotlex]
2005/11/14
	* New Visual Studio projects, compiling works, need zlib.dll for txt server. [Kevin]
	* Longing for Freedom can't be used during Moonlight Petals now. [Skotlex]
	* Corrected True Sight's critical bonus (from +0.1 cri per level to +1 cri
	  per level) [Skotlex]
	* Made coma a status effect. SC_COMA. Sets HP/SP to 1. Bosses/Emperium are
	  inmune to it. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed null pointer crash in battle_damage. [Skotlex]
	* Increased max account variables to 32. [Skotlex]
	* Pressure/Gloria Domini now isn't instant-cancelled by status effects, and
	  bypasses the Devotion/Sacrifice check. [Skotlex]
	* Added handling of the /pk packet, even thought it just shows an empty
	  listing for now. [Skotlex]
	* Applied zBuffer's suggested fix to prevent S. Novices from getting mental
	  Strength at 100% exp. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed Friends List not able to add more than 20 friends (current clients support up to 40) [Lupus]
	  thanks to CAHTEXNIK for pointing it out 8)
2005/11/12
	* Probably fixed the name of freshly captured pet eggs. [Skotlex]
	* Changes Win32 to not require svnversion.h, but instead tries to peek in
	  .svn\entries to check for svn version. If the file doesn't exist it'll
	  display "Unknown" though, which I guess isn't a good thing ^^; [celest]
	* Removed the option to load zlib as a plugin for Win32 since it should be
	  linked at compile time [celest]
	* Added zlib and libmysql .lib files for compiling in Visual Studio [celest]
	  Note: The project files on SVN don't have them yet, you'll need to include
		them yourself for now
	* Fixed a compile error in Visual Studio [celest]
	* Readded a missing zlib file needed by Win32, sorry ^^; [celest]
2005/11/11
	* New readme content/layout (IE warning: IE hates new readme) [Evera]
	* Imported use of the refine weapon packets from jA. [Skotlex]
	* Removed SC_MODE, now NPC_EMOTION and NPC_EMOTION_ON can change a mob's
	  mode permanently (until their death, that is), and it won't work on
	  player summoned mobs. As before, val1 is the emotion value, val2 is the
	  mode to add/remove. Val3 is now ignored (used to be duration) [Skotlex]
	  (no, no need to wipe SC data this time around either)
	* Cleaned up sql-files to use TYPE rather than ENGINE as TYPE is supported
	  by older MySQL versions and not quite deprecated yet. [Skotlex]
	* Modified the party even share exp bonus to be +10% per extra party member
	  as official sources state. [Skotlex]
	* Organized the clif_devotion packet, and added clif_marionette as per
	  jA's implementation. [Skotlex]
	* Added db_path to map_athena.conf, used to specify an alternate directory
	  to locate the db/ files. Defaults to "db", obviously. [Skotlex]
	* Removed SC_FALCON and SC_RIDING, the status icons are directly managed
	  through the change of the character's option now. The actual defines were
	  not removed to avoid shifting all the SC_ values again (no need to wipe sc
	  data) [Skotlex]
	* Added additional debug information to battle_attr_fix until the cause of
	  those errors are found and resolved. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed win32 compiles always reporting "unable to set socket to
	  non-blocking mode", together with other minor win32 fixes. [Skotlex]
2005/11/10
	* Fixed char-sql cart loading. [Skotlex]
	* Updated the function that specifies the cards to support more than four
	  slots. [Skotlex]
	- Since the packets are fixed sized the client can never receive data of
	  more than four cards, therefore if the client was compiled with MAX_SLOTS
	  above 4, a random subset of cards will be sent each time the item data is
	  sent (eg: if the item has 6 slots, it may randomly choose to send cards
	  1->4, 2->5, or 3->6).
	* Removed the OnAgitInit call when the map connects to char server. Fixes
	  double guardian spawn. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed the sql query strings that would appear "incomplete" under certain
	  *nix systems. [Skotlex]
	* Applied zBuffer's patches to correct memory leaks in the PCRE module
	  (regular expression support for npcs) and prevent server crashing when
	  scripts divide (or do mod %) by zero. [Skotlex
2005/11/09
	* Fixed Ankle Snare and Spider Web not being cleared when the trapped
	  target dies. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed the range flag being incorrectly set in BF_MISC skill attacks.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Corrected Venom Knife using Level1 always for the poisoning chance rather
	  than learned Envenom's level. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed the crash on shutdown if PCRE support was enabled. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed possible item duping while vending, thanks to End of Exam for
	  pointing it out. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed the blue aura of Night effect. Thanks to zBuffer [Skotlex]
	* Fixed mobs moving one tile when hit even if they can't move (this is what
	  broke Ankle Snare) [Skotlex]
	* Fixed night/day implementation (which broke due to the addition of SI_
	  constants). [Skotlex]
	* Cleaned up the SI_ constants to have defined only those which actually
	  display something on the client. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed a bug which caused a captured pet's name to be displayed as beloved
	  even though it was just captured. [Skotlex]
	* Added temp skill quests for all complete 2nd Class Quest Skills [Lupus]
2005/11/08
	* Updated the documentation on the announce script commands. [Skotlex]
	* Removed the global color message support as there's now a way to craft
	  custom colored announces. [Skotlex]
	* Probably fixed mapannounce. [Skotlex]
	* Implemented SI_ constants to specify the icon number for different SC_
	  changes, idea adopted from jAthena. All SC_ data was reorganized and
	  several checks are now in place. It is likely all saved sc_data is wrong
	  after this update due to the numbers changing places. It won't cause any
	  glue-boots.. but the wrong status changes will be loaded the first time
	  anyway, so it may be a good idea to wipe that file/table for this update.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Added mob boss inmunity to status changes: poison, curse, deadly poison.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Now when the mob starts casting a skill and stops walking, a packet will
	  be sent to update the mob position on the clients. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed a bug in mob_stop_walking which may fix stun-lock. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed not showing named/carded items in Vending [Lupus]
	  (when you drag'n'drop them from your cart into your shop list)
2005/11/07
	* Expanded script commands announce/mapannounce/mapareaannounce to take an
	  additional parameter to define the color. This uses the new packet 0x1c3 to
	  send the broadcast, and even though the packet is not fully understood yet,
	  it should be at the point where it can be used. [Skotlex]
	- eg: "announce "hello world", bc_map, 0xFFFF00;"
	* Cleaned up and optimized the way card data is set in packets. Should
	  correct most, if not all, pet-egg related issues. [Skotlex]
	* Removed combo_damage_delay and added damage_walk_delay_rate. Now the total
	  delay during which you can't move is a percent of the normal damage delay
	  rate adjusted by number of hits and this rate. Defaults to 50% for now. [Skotlex]
	* Removed the random damage delay value from status_get_dmotion as it is
	  not really helping the walk-stun-lock. [Skotlex]
	* Made Gravitation ignore target's cards. [Skotlex]
	* Updated readme with new layout [Evera]
	* Updated bAddMonsterDropItem bonuses to work with cards: Mimic Card, Mystcase Card
	  where bonus_item_rate = base_rate * (killed_mob_level/10) + 1
  	  So if 2nd argument is negative, then it's 'rate'
  	  Now, if you kill Porings, u'd have OBB/GIFT BOX drops with 0.01% chance
	  and if u kill Leaf Cats then u'd have them with 0.05% chance
	  Max chance is 0.1% (when u kill MVPs with level > 94) [Lupus]
2005/11/06
	* Cleaned up a bit the warp portal code. [Skotlex]
	* Added a timer to invoke the OnAgitInit event 10 seconds after the char/map
	  servers are connected. Scripts should now carefully use OnInit to load the
	  castle data, and OnAgitInit to check for castle owners, mobs, WoE, etc.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Reverted the  damage delay equation to 800 -4*agi, which is the correct
	  data from packets examined. [Skotlex]	
	* Slow motion Fix: Reverted weight packet, thanks to Momoko [Lupus]
2005/11/05
	* Fixes on sending to client status of char (guild, position, etc). [LuzZza]
	* Updated backsliding to work as it should. [Skotlex]
	* Added back the GPL licence on the root directory (why was this removed?)
	  [Skotlex]
	* Fixed knock-back packets, thanks to Vicious for collecting the packet
	  samples. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed pretty much all ground skills not working when you "walked into
	  them" (they were fine if casted on top of you, though) [Skotlex]
	* Fixed not working ZENY LOG. You can use logging filter as well. [Lupus]
		- Only SQL logs available.
		- Logs only Vending, Trade, Shops yet
		- Don't forget to update your logs SQL DB and log_athena.conf
	* Added previously removed (by an accident) "MVP Prize item log" into pick_log [Lupus]
2005/11/04
	* Added support for new quest skills to @allskills/@skillall. Thanks again to blackhole89 for 
	  pointing that out! [Kayla]
	* Fixed various occurencies of assuming Guild Skills being >= ID 10000 
	  rather than 500<skill<1000 still after skill_chk. Thanks blackhole89! [Kayla]
	* Hopefully fixed Weapon Refine. [Skotlex]
	* Applied a change which prevents pc_setpos from working for characters
	  between maps, as doing so makes the character appear on a different
	  position on the client than the position stored in the server. [Skotlex]
	* Added friend_db option to inter_athena.conf, now friend table is
	  usable in multi server and/or custom db configs. [Foruken]
2005/11/03
	* Corrected the basilica check which should disable casting offensive
	  skills from within inside the basilica. [Skotlex]
	* Modifed status_change_end to prevent peco-peco/falcon from ending until
	  the player's 'falcon/peco option' value is removed first. [Skotlex]
	* Removed the knockback code for players and changed it for a "fix
	  position" code. The new code is not right as it makes your character
	  "teleport" to the position rather than walk really fast to it, but it fixes
	  the "Do not use bot!" messages. [Skotlex]
	  (someone has to log the actual packets used when being knocked/knocking
	  back for this to really be fixed)
	* Heaven Drive now can target traps. [Skotlex]
	  (I find it impossible to target a trap with Arrow Shower unless the
	  skill's info is set to 32 -target traps-, but when it's done so, the
	  client refuses to use the skill on enemies, and mode 33 makes the skill
	  useless. How does one makes this work?)
	* Various cleanups to the skill system. [Skotlex]
	* Update: Now your cast cancels on recieving status change such as:
	  Stun, Stone Curse, Freeze or Sleep [LuzZza]
	* Updated the code to allow the Emperium to be inflicted by Pneuma and
	  Safety Wall. [Skotlex]
	* Updated @recallall to revive any dead characters before moving them,
	  should fix that weird ghost bug. [Skotlex]
2005/11/02
	* Made Spell breaker not be able to cancel Pressure/Gloria domini [Skotlex]
	* Another fix/optimization to thenight/day system. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed possibility of freezing / stunning already frozen/stunned players
	- Now you can't freeze an already frozen one [Lupus]
	* Fixed non-GMs allowing send trade requests from far places [Lupus]
	* Fix of lowest_gm_level (inter_athena), now logins with access under
	  lowest_gm_level overides gm_can_drop_lv. [Kayla]
	* Spell Breaker now works on any skill with a cast time. [Skotlex]
	* Made Dispell not work on Meltdown and Cart Boost [Skotlex]
	* Made Meltdown not dispellable upon death. [Skotlex]
	* Probably fixed Warp Portal [Skotlex]
	* Fixed players being able to mute others even if their gm level is not
	  high enough to use @mute [Skotlex]
	* Fixed Dispell not clearing a lot of status changes it should. [Skotlex]
	* Corrected the way the Emperium skill-defense works. Damage skills other
	  than Gloria Domini, Raging Trifecta and Gravitation do no damage. Status
	  changing skills have no effect, and normal heal heals for 0. [Skotlex]
	* Some more corrections to the night/day system. [Skotlex]
	* Multiple fixes to the skill system. Should fix Warp Portal, Teleport and
	  mob skills crashing the server. [Skotlex]
	* Updated sql-files/item_db.sql with the latest. [Skotlex]
	* Some optimizations to the script config events loading/storing/saving.
	  (Somehow it fixes the warning from the memory manager on shutdown...)
	  [Skotlex]
2005/11/01
	* Updated battle_check_target to allow ground skills that affect "Everyone"
	  to affect the emperium, only the ones that target only enemies will have no
	  effect. [Skotlex]
	* Changed the default of mob_max_skilllv from 11 to 100, as many of the
	  recent mobs use higher level skills. [Skotlex]
	* Moved the check which made emperiums receive 0 damage to: [Skotlex]
	- status_check_skilluse, so that all targetted skills fail.
	- battle_check_target, so that all ground-based offensive skills fail.
	* Cleaned up a bit the skill related code. [Skotlex]
	* Updated @ commands. NO command comes at gm-level 0 by default now, that's how
	  it should be, the new default minimum is 1 for most trivial @ commands. Also added
	  a bunch of commands to conf/atcommand.conf which were missing. I STRONGLY
	  recommend everyone to at least fetch the new atcommand file as there
	  were abusable commands at level 0 (abusable in the sense they can incur
	  performance penalties if over-used by everyone) [Skotlex]
	* Fixed crash when a mob was killed while under Rich Man Kim effect by a
	  non-player, also fixes Rich Man Kim not giving the correct exp bonus.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Modified the socket subsystem to not close all connections on an "Service
	  Temporarily Unavailable" error (it is a non-fatal error which basicly means
	  "try again later").  [Skotlex]

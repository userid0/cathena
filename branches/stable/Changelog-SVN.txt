Date	Added
06/1
	* Changed DoppelGanger card's attack speed increase to 30%. [Skotlex]
	  This card current does not stacks. If anyone knows of a valid source that
	  says otherwise, open a bug-report so it can be corrected.
	* Added Maeki's fix for handling the sql connection to the log server [Skotlex]
	* A reminder to people who seem to have a broken item_db (wrong item
	  sprites, doing nothing on click, etc): there was an update to item_db
	  some days ago, a new column which is used to determine refineable 
	  items (which goes between eLv and View) The shipped item_db.txt is
	  already updated, but if you have custom files, you can try updating
	  them using the gawk line (further below this changelog) or this short
	  sed command (from within the db directory):
	  gsed -re 's/([^,]*,){16}/&,/' < item_db.txt > item_db.fix
	  And then replace item_db.txt with the newly created file (if ya don't
	  have gsed, try sed. All *nix should come with one or the other, and you
	  can also get it with cygwin)
	* Moved the dynamic mob spawns/deletes to map_addblock/map_delblock [Skotlex]
	  This pretty much guarantees that mobs won't be spawned/deleted twice from
	  the same map.
	* Added random's battle_config flag for enabling/disabling dynamic mobs [Skotlex]
	  Dynamic mobs is good for medium to small servers, but on large ones it
	  gets to be somewhat pointless.
	* Fixed disp_hpmeter, I think (can't test it, but the code looks ok) [Skotlex]
	* Added battle athena option mob_remove_delay [Skotlex]
	  Now dynamic mobs are not removed inmediately, but after some time has
	  passed. Default value is 60 secs
	* Added debugging information about dynamic mobs [Skotlex]
	  Helps keep track of how many mobs are being removed/spawned, use it to
	  track any possible bugs! Should be removed after dynamic mobs are good
	  enough.
	* Some changes to dynamic mob unloading to avoid remove summoned mobs and
	always remove mob slaves.	[Skotlex]
	* Fixed a nasty pc.c bug thanks to komurka [massdriller]
	* Added Sasuke's modification to allow certain gm levels to see the 
	  hp bars [massdriller]

05/31
	* Added Einbroch mobs to dead branch DB [Arutema]
	* Fixed NPC Typo [Codemaster]
	* Updated help.txt, fixed a compile time warning on BSD systems. [Kevin]
	* @marry auto-gives named rings, removed @rings as in-needed [Arutema]
	* Fixed some compilation errors in BSD systems. [Kevin]
	* Restored dynamic mob cleaning to what it was a couple of nights ago
	  Should send the system back before all hell broke loose. [Skotlex]
	* Added battle_config options min_hitrate & max_hitrate	[Skotlex]
	  These only affect the new attack function, and th defaults are 5%-95%
	* Added client-messages for when an item can't be drop/stored [Skotlex]
	* Finished implementing the "optimization" item_trade.txt [Skotlex]
	* Optimised the long forgotten MVP arena [massdriller]

05/30
	* Rewrote the trade-add-item function, it was hella messy [Skotlex]
	* Updated item_trade.txt implementation [Skotlex]
	  GM-override lv is still to be implemented.
	  Code has been reviewed, but not actually tested yet, use with caution.
	* Fixed fame list first loading, at server startup [DracoRPG]
	* added lordalfa's @me action command [massdriller]
	* Reverted changes to dynamic mob removal, now all mobs are removed [Skotlex]
	  mob_remove_damaged is still respected.
	* Partial implementation of item_trade.txt, not quite finished yet [Skotlex]
	* Fixed mob_remove_damaged [Skotlex]
	* Added two new battle_athena options:	[Skotlex]
	  show_hp_sp_drain (yes/no): displays drained hp/sp from attacks (ie:
	  Hunter Fly Card)
	  show_hp_sp_gain (yes/no): displays gained hp/sp from killing mobs (ie:
	  Sky Deleter Card)
	* bHPGainValue, bSPGainValue will only display gained hp/sp when said
	gain is above 0. [Skotlex]
	* Changed hp_dispmeter from yes/no to GM-level [Skotlex]
	  Note that now the default value is hp_dispmeter: 100
	* Fixed item_avail.txt reading could crash on newline [celest]
	* Speedup and fixed @reloaditemdb messing up inventory data [celest]

05/29
	* Optimised job quests scripts [massdriller]
	* Fixed guild expulsion bug, two chars on same account would be expelled. [Kevin]
	* Dynamic mob unloading won't touch mobs with a deletetimer now [Skotlex]
	  this affects mobs scheduled to be removed (including @summon mobs)
	* Dynamic mobs now also removes mobs that have a master [Skotlex]
	* Fixed Knockback skills on the new attack function [Skotlex]
	* Rewrote the vitality reduction equation in the new attack funcion [Skotlex]
	  The new equation conforms to rodatazone's information here:
	  http://rodatazone.simgaming.net/mechanics/substats.php#def
	* Fixed item_db.txt to contain the new refinable column [Skotlex]
	  (I accidentally commited the old item_db last time...)
	  TXT users with custom items can update their custom db using gawk (*nix
	  or under Cygwin) this way (thanks to Sasuke):
	  gawk -F, '{ for (i=1; i<= NF; i++) { if (i==16) { printf $i; printf ",";printf ","; } else if ( i==NF ) { print $i; } else { printf $i; printf ","; } } }' db/item_db2.txt > item_db2.new.txt
	  Run it from within the root eAthena directory, and you'll get an updated
	  item_db2.txt in your root directory. However, all custom items are not
	  refineable by default this way, you still have to set to 1 the refineable
	  column where it applies on your custom item_db.
	* Improved uptime checking, by Shinomori
	* Improved calltable import/exporting, by Shinomori
	* Standardised init/finalise functions' names [celest]
	* Fixed SVN version display at client connection, thanks to Maeki [DracoRPG]
	* Prevented Snatcher to try stealing players and already stolen mobs, thanks to shadow [DracoRPG]
	* Fixed Parrying and slightly organized status_change_start [DracoRPG]
	* Removed fame list update timer and made it to refresh the list everytime pc_addfame is ran [DracoRPG]

05/28
	~ Name of NPC file in map_athena.conf is now scripts_main.conf
	~ Added a new column to item_db.txt/item_db2.txt: refineable [Skotlex]
	  The column goes between equip_level and view, use upgrade_svn1863.sql
	  to update sql tables (including item_db2.txt). Custom item users of txt
	  servers will have to update manually.
	  When the column's value is 0, NULL (sql) or blank (txt), the item can't be
	  refined.
	  OLD ITEM_DBS WILL NOT WORK WITH THIS NEW UPDATE, update your custom
	  items!
		
	* Fixed a crash bug in pet_heal_timer on timer mismatch. [Skotlex]
	  Thanks to Celest for noticing it out.
	* Fixed the critical attacks bug in the new attack function. [Skotlex]
	* Added MassDriller's updated readme.html files. [committed by Skotlex]
	* Fixed script_athena.conf reading of "event_requires_trigger". [Skotlex]
	  It was looking for "require_set_trigger" instead of
	  "event_requires_trigger", which effectively ignored the
	  event_require_trigger's value. Logout events should now be usable without
	  the need of a global variable.
	* Registered all used timer functions to help debugging [celest]
	* Added -DMINICORE to compile core.c (for converters and ladmin) [celest]
	* Removed most unused code and files in char and login converters [celest]
	* Moved converters to /txt-converters [celest]
	* Some tidying up in core and socket.c [celest]
	* Fixed a bug in the new attack function dealing with dual-wielding [Skotlex]

05/27
	* Removed YET AGAIN the mob's skill_idle_flag function. [Skotlex]
	  Komurka updated the mob_skill_db so that it is not needed anymore.
	* Modified the critical equation on the new attack function [Skotlex]
	  The original equation ((1 + LUK*0.3 + EquipmentBonuses) * CritModifier -
	  TargetLuk/5) was meant for official servers, where mobs don't do
	  criticals. If applied to mobs, they get very high critical rate, so the
	  luk reduction was bumped up to TargetLuk*3/10 on situations where a player
	  is targeted by a mob.
	* Re-Applied the idle_skill_flag [Skotlex]
	  It was removed because people said it was broken, however it works
	  exactly the way Komurka explained it to me:
	  A mob can cast only one idle skill, and can't do another one until it
	  moves. If the mob casts too many idle skills because it
	  casts/moves/casts, then increase the skill's delay in the database! If it
	  still does "not works", drop me a line explaining why, because it works
	  exactly as I was told it should.
	* Small adjustment of the critical equation in the new attack function [Skotlex]
	* Fixed some crashes related to pet skills and timers [Skotlex]
	* Fixed 1 delete_timer error with pc_stopwalking [celest]

05/26
	* Tidied up mob.c and map.c a bit [celest]
	* Removed rehash() in atcommand.c [celest]
	* Fixed @reloadscript issue with dynamic mobs [celest]
	* Added flush fifos first before reloading in @reloadscript [celest]
	* Added spawn mobs with 1 second delay instead if moblist is full, by Shinomori
	* Fixed wrong name saved when adding friends, thanks to Maeki
	* Fixed itemhealrate stackable, thanks to starlon
	* Set the new_attack_function to be used by default. [Skotlex]
	  This function replaces the three previously used functions (pc/mob/pet)
	  into a single one which was rewritten to follow the attack algorythm as
	  described in http://rodatazone.simgaming.net/mechanics/attacks.php
	  Please report any inconsistencies or strange behaviour that this new
	  function brings (only affects physical attacks/skills) on the boards.
	  If anyone can do some performance comparisons with the old method, that'd
	  be useful too.
	  If you absolutely don't want to test it and prefer the old method, in
	  battle_athena.conf add a line that goes:
	  new_attack_function: no

05/25
	* Fixed typos in Absorb Spirits, Double Casting and Tarot Card, thanks to Komurka
	  and Avaj
	* Added missing code for Flasher, thanks to Komurka
	* Fixed a string bug in grfio_resnametable [celest]
	* Updated the readme files to the current statistics. [Mass Zero]

	* Added capability to export to plugins [celest]
	* Fixed ensemble skills, thanks to Komurka
	* Fixed Dissonance damage, thanks to shadow
	* Reverted db/pet_db.txt to it's original form.	[Skotlex]
	  The pet skills shipped with eA should be as close as possible to the
	  original servers. If you prefer the current custom skills in place just don't
	  update the pet_db.txt file.
`	  (Somehow my custom pet skills table got updated to svn and I didn't notice
	  it ^^') 

05/23

	* Fixed a previous fix with pet idle skills, needs db update not hard coding. [Kevin]
	* Fixed mysql queries to support the following: [Kevin]
	  -Names now support the ' character

	  -Debug option to revert back to old debug queries, will disable the support of the two above.
	* Added No Dead Branching Mapflags in cities [massdriller]
	* Fixed an inconsistent message for log_chat in conf file reading [celest]

	  - nojobexp - on killing a monster you don't obtain Job EXP at all (including MVP EXP bonus)
		nobaseexp+nojobexp=noexp
	in other words, 'noexp' set both mapflags 'nobaseexp' and 'nojobexp'
	  - noloot - on killing ANY monster you get no loot at all
	  - nomobloot - on killing a common monster you get no loot at all
	  - nomvploot - on killing a MVP monster you get no MVP loot at all
		nomobloot+nomvploot=noloot
	in other words, 'noloot' set both mapflags 'nomobloot' and 'nomvploot'

05/12
	* Very very very strong weapons (forged with 3 Star Crumbs) now give +40 dmg
	  instead of +15 dmg [DracoRPG]
	* Weapons/potions made by a top-10 famous player now give bonus effects [DracoRPG]
	* Updated the battle.c change made to generate compile time
        errors if you put the wrong battle_config option with the
        wrong type into the wrong place [MouseJstr]
	* Added item type 11 into LOGs filter [Lupus]
	* Removed mob_skill_use, if you don't want mobskills, set mob_skill_rate to 
	  zero [Skotlex]
	* Modified drops_by_luk behaviour. See battle_athena.conf for details [Skotlex]
	  The new system works a lot like Diablo 2, where having 100% better chance
	  of finding items means that you basicly get double drop rates than others.
	* Implemented pet idle skills restrictions as explained by Komurka [Skotlex]
	  From what I was told, a mob can only cast a skill while in idle state
	  once, and it needs to move before it can do another idle-state skill.
	* Tested and fixed wedding_ignorepalette, it now works as it should [Skotlex]
	* Tested the new item type 11. I forgot to add the code for the sql
	  version, but that's now fixed and the new system works as it should [Skotlex]
	* Put a fix in for the bug mentioned below [MouseJstr]
	* Added code to make min_hair_style, max_hair_style, min_hair_color,
	  max_hair_color, min_cloth_color, max_cloth_color work [Skotlex]
	  What it does, is cap the values whenever you try to change the
	  character's dye via an npc/script, it won't touch character's dye colors
	  upon loading.
	* Shrinked @mapinfo output, added 2 missing flags NOWARP / NOWARPTO [Lupus]
	* New item type (11) to item_db: delay-consumed usables. [Skotlex]
	. All items that have in their script "pet" or "itemskill" must be changed
	  from type 2 to 11. The new type of item has the property of not being
	  consumed on double click, but after a target is selected (hence it is
	  ideal for lures, skill-casting items and the yggdrasil leaf)
	  The item_db.txt file was updated to reflect these changes. Custom pet 
	  lure owners, update!
	  SQL users can run upgrade_svn1705.sql which will upgrade both item
	  databases (including all custom lures)
	* Added battle config option 'ignore_items_gender'. [Lupus]
	  So any player can equip any item regardless of the gender restrictions.
	  Note: It's ignored by default since gender check isn't implemented at
			official servers.
	  There are 2 exceptions: Wedding Ring M/ Wedding Ring F (their gender check
	  won't be affected)

05/11
	* Added by popular demand battle config options mob_skill_rate & 
	  mob_skill_delay. See battle_athena.conf for further information. [Skotlex]
	* Added battle config option wedding_ignorepalette (default no)
	  When enabled, the wedding dress/tux will always display with the default
	  dye (not all palette packs bring palettes for the wedding class, nor
	  they should) (Needs testing)
	* Changed most battle_athena options to unsigned short. This means the
	  maximum valid value is around 60K (65535 on most systems) which 
	  translates to ~60 secs or 600% (600x) for most options. See 
	  conf-tmpl/battle_athena.conf for details on which variables were
	  excluded (exp/drop rates values are excluded, obviously).
	* Removed boss warping code since it is currently supported by the mob skill DB
	  'rudeattacked' state [celest]
	* Fixed plagiarised skills replacing actual learnt skills [celest]
	* Fixed 'gmcommand' script command crashing when no players are attached [celest]
	  ... which means the command does not work in script events like OnClock!
05/10
	* Added code to prevent pet lures from being wasted until after selecting a
	target (only works with official lures). [Skotlex]
	* Added MAX_REFINE to status.h [Skotlex]
	  Enables for custom max refine levels using the success rates in
	  refine_db.txt, npcs will know they reached the max level when the success
	  chance returns 0. (npcs still need updating to support this model)
	  - Note: Whitesmith's refinery skill might need to be tweaked if you want
	  them to be able to forge above lv10 and up to whatever custom max you
	  wish.
	  - Note2: Npc's refine_sucess script command ignores this max.
	* Skill updates [celest]
	  - Fixed Charge Arrow not requiring bows
	  - Fixed Enchant Deadly Poison working on bosses
	  - Fixed Concentration (again! xD) def penalty, thanks to UniRing
	  - Added code for NPC_REVENGE
	* Added 'masterattacked' mob skill condition [celest]
	* Added battle_config.use_statpoint_table [Skotlex]
	  When set to no, a new equation is used to calculate stat points after a
	  reset. I've tested the equation to death, so it should work flawlessly.
	  Advantages of using the equation: No need for statpoint.txt (it is still
	  read for the time being), and stat changes through npc buyers/sellers are
	  preserved after a reset.
	* Restructured clif_parse_Wanttoconnection [celest]
	* Fixed packet version detecting not working properly if last version's connection
	  packet is the same as the DB but with different values [celest]
	* Added built-in support for 2005-05-09aSakexe and changed 'packet_ver_flag'
	  default in battle conf to 511 [celest]
	* Added load local resnametables.txt into memory instead of opening and reading
	  it every time we look for a file [celest]
	* Fixed crash if resnametables.txt was not found in a grf [celest]
	* Removed some unnecessary steps in grf file lists loading [celest]
	* Added display_hallucination for clients where the effect lags badly [Skotlex]
	* Added the battle_config options for managing the pet-skills system [Skotlex]
	* Incorporated the new pet attack/skill system. [Skotlex]
	  See db/pet_db.txt for explanation, or visit 
	  http://www.eathena.deltaanime.net/board/index.php?showtopic=29918 for
	  details and support.
	* Fixed Marionette skill. Now you can't target other Clowns or Gypsies [Lupus]
	* Fixed all Hunters traps to affect Players in PVP/GVG places only. [Lupus]
	  And Shockwave Trap doesn't work on monsters, because they don't have SP

05/09
	~ Added sql_files/upgrade_svn1665.sql to update hair, hair colour and clothes
	  colours' field format (thanks to Zoc)

	* Updated char creation to support 24 hairstyles (from 5/10's patch) [celest]
	* Fixed broken stats check during SQL char creation, thanks to Sasuke
	* Removed an unnecessary check in plugins loading, thanks to Shinomori
	* Changed grfio_read + grfio_size usage to grfio_reads() -- a bit faster [celest]
	* Moved the win32 zlib .h files from /lib to /zlib [celest]
	* Moved 'afm_dir' setting to map_athena.conf [celest]
	* Moved grfio.c from /common to /map [celest]
	* Changed grf-files.txt loading: [celest]

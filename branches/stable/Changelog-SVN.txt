Date	Added
=======
08/25
	* Cleaned up mob_db.txt and updated sql-files/mob_db.sql [Skotlex]
	  Sql users can just feed mysql the .sql file and it will delete and refill
	  the table with the most updated db data.
	* Corrections to damage versus plants. [Skotlex]
	  MAGIC and MISC attacks do 1 damage per hit.
	  WEAPON attacks do 1 damage, display miss if they hit multiple times.
	* Instead of knocking back (which wasn't even working), characters that are
	  stepping on an icewall will cause that tile of the icewall to 'die' [Skotlex]
	* Final damage equation update to Acid Demonstration. [Skotlex]
	  (it still won't ignore the raydric card, but why that is official in
	  itself is a big mystery)
	* Added status change for temporary boosts of stats, plus added the
	  following constants (db/const.txt): [Skotlex]
	  - SC_IncAll, SC_IncStr, SC_IncAgi, SC_IncVit, SC_IncInt, SC_IncDex,
	  SC_IncDex
	  - It hasn't been tested yet what kind of visual these will cause
	    client-side.
	  (Now someone go and write down the script for the food items xP)
	* Updated @summon to take a second parameter: duration. [Skotlex]
	  eg: "@summon lunatic 40" will summon a lunatic that lasts 40 mins or
	  until killed. Max duration is one hour.
	* Updated Some Mobs Spawns, Drops check npc\changelog.txt [Lupus]
	* Some toning down of the damage of Acid Demonstration (should /100, not
	  /10) [Skotlex]
	* Likely fixed Blitzbeat from hitting neutral chars. [Skotlex]
	* Updated Acid Demonstration to be a MISC skill who's damage is (base_Atk *
	  caster's int * target's vit /10) (half that on players). It's much more
	  closer to official values than the previous ones... [Skotlex]
	* Corrected Pressure sapping SP even if you hide from it. [Skotlex]
	  (isn't Pressure a holy attack from the grand god himself? How can a thief
	  HIDE from his eyes? o.O)
	* Updated Acid Demonstration damage formula. It's still wrong, but at least
	  it considers int and vit now. [Skotlex]
	  Current dummy formula: (100 + caster's int + target's vit)*(number of hits)%
08/24
	* Updated pet skills database. [Skotlex]
	* Some corrections to socket.c, should stop all the recent crashing... [Skotlex]
	* Added a case to knockback enemies if they somehow end up stepping into an
	  ice wall tile [Skotlex]
	* Added checks to prevent walking, attacking or using skills while the
	  storage is open. [Skotlex]
	* Added Lupus's mob skills for Einbroch mobs [Skotlex]
	* (almost) rewrite of the storage system. [Skotlex]
	  Storages are marked dirty after an item is stored/retrieved from them and
	  will not be marked clean until the char-server acks the save request.
	  Upon map-server reconnection to the char, all storages that are currently
	  closed and dirty are saved.
	* Synched chrif_save with the storage save functions when either one is
	  open to further prevent exploits. [Skotlex]
	* Updated the mob_skill_db with Komurka's translation (Aegis -> eA) [Skotlex]
	  The max permilliage (rate) is now 10000 = 100%
	* Various mob related summon/metamorphosis changes: [Skotlex]
	  - Summon Mob/Slave's level is the total number of mobs to summon, when the
	  skill definition offers multiple mobs, they are spawned in order
	  (round-robin scheme).
	  - Metamorphosis/Transformation level is the total number of mobs to
	  multiply into. Uses the same criteria as summon mob and the original mob
	  is deleted/killed (no loot drop). If the level is 1, then the mob transforms
	  into one of the defined classes randomly.
	  - Note that beyond code-proofreading and making sure it compiles, this
	  has not been tested yet!
	* Added the bonus provided by the /doridori command to TK_HPTIME and TK_SPTIME. [Dralnu]
	  Thanks to Duduc.
	* Updated battle_check_target to check using the master instead of the
	  slaves (applies for mobs/pets) [Skotlex]
	  - Should prevent slaves from attacking their master
	* Implemented TK_HPTIME and TK_SPTIME exept the bonus provided by /doridori [Dralnu]
	* Implemented delayed character logout [Skotlex]
	  How it works: When a player quits the server when they shouldn't (force
	  disconnect before the 10 secs, or leave when the char server is not
	  connected) his session is closed, but the player is left in-game just
	  like in @autotrade, and a timer is added. Every 10 secs it'll check if
	  the char server is online, and then save the character and delete it from
	  the map server. NOT TESTED YET, so report any anomalies.
	* Fixed Shield Chain's skill-type (it's short ranged, not long?) [Skotlex]
	* Fixed Decrease Agility's equation. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed root'ed monks not being able to use root skills. [Skotlex]
	* Added inter-server option "kick_on_disconnect" (defaults to yes) [Skotlex]
	   - The only people who may want to change it are overcrowded servers where
	  the char/map server link breaks due to overload and then everyone is
	  kicked out until said connection is reestablished.
	  - Of course, use at your own discretion until all possible exploits
	  caused by this are resolved.
08/23
	* Fixed provoke's success chance. [Skotlex]
	* Battle_check_target update, should fix party/guild skills failing when
	  checking against yourself. [Skotlex]
	* Updated map and char servers to allow them to reconnect without having to
	  kick out all players. [Skotlex]
	  - This is still experimental and what possible exploits may come from it
	  are yet unknown (however, considering that the reconnection should take
	  place in a few seconds after the disconnection...)
	  - Note that storage contents and player contents are all kept in the map
	  server's memory, unsaved data will be lost if player forces a
	  disconnection, storage changes will also be lost if they are open/closed
	  during said disconnection (and NOT reclosed after the connection is
	  restablished)
	  - These and more stuff might come up with time. Report away!
	* Updated Gospel to not buff up Guildmates, only Party members. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed @autotrade [Skotlex]
	  (tested on a limited scenario with few characters, needs more testing.
	  Test and report!)
	* Implemented TK_STORMKICK, TK_DOWNKICK, TK_COUNTER and TK_TURNKICK. [Dralnu]
	  Note that at the moment if you use theses skills even if the corresponding
	  SC is inactive, it will use SP and will stop you if you are attacking.
	  Note too that because we don't know how it should work exactly, when a SC such as
	  SC_STORMKICK will be launched, it will notice you by a little message over your 
	  head : Hit now !!.  Finaly, TK_TURNKICK will not yet have the pushback effect.
	* Fixed everyone having 20 flee... I hope. [Skotlex]
	* Some corrections and updates to mob skill Metamorphosis [Skotlex]
	  (don't know if it'll work now, but the way it was before definitely was
	  not working)
	* Probably fixed infinite endure wearing out when being hit. [Skotlex]
	* Updated gvg range penalties to be as in official servers. [Skotlex]
	  - Skills (weapon/magic/misc) get a 40% penalty
	  - Ranged normal attacks get a 20% penalty, melee receives no penatly.
	  (battle flag gvg_weapon_attack_rate added to complete configuration)
	* Added the -20 flee penalty on GVG grounds. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed Enchant Deadly Poison's Damage (it was 500% - 5x at level 5, not 400%
	  - 4x) [Skotlex]
	* Fixed Soul Breaker's magical part of the attack taking element -1 rather
	  than 0. [Skotlex]
	* Login sql server will now only clear sstatus data of connected servers
	  rather than clean the table. [Skotlex]
	* Added some checks to prevent infinite looping in the char servers. [Skotlex]
	* Some updates to the way disconnections are handled in socket.c [Skotlex]
08/22	
	* Fixed typo in skill.c causing errors [Codemaster]
	* Added Irmin's recommendation to allow item names in getitenname() [Skotlex]
	  (kinda odd to use an item's name to get the item's name, isn't it?)
	* Fixed Meteor Assault not displaying damage. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed WE_CALLPARENT crashing the map server when either parent is
	  offline. [Skotlex]
	* Added TK_HIGHJUMP. Note : To be able to see properly the full jump animation,
	  casting time will not depend on DEX. [Dralnu]
	* Somes fixes in skill_db.txt and skill_cast_db.txt about Taekwon's skills. [Dralnu]
	* Fully implemented the STR bonus part of TK_RUN [DracoRPG]
	* Added activation/unactivation of TK stances, but not their specific effects [DracoRPG]
	* Reverted magnum break, removed the Flame Launcher status change until
	  actual bonus can be implemented. [Skotlex]
	* Skills update (mostly thanks to Vicious Pucca): [Skotlex]
	  - Success chance and stats of Provoke, mental Break, Signum Crusis, Soul Burn
	  - Decrease Agility duration halved for players.
	  - Magnum Break's final damage is splitted 80% weapon's element, 20% fire
	    element. No longer causes weapon endow.
	  - Bash's hit bonus (+5 per lv now)
	* Fixed skill_db, Added perfect hit to TK_COUNTER [Dralnu]
	* Changed skill_tree and job_db1 the same way I changed job_db2, it was necessary for
	  clear implementation of Taekwon (which has a very unusual ID for a 1st job) and renders
	  the code less messy (at least it's my humble opinion ^^) although it could be slightly,
	  but really slightly, more RAM-consuming [DracoRPG]
	* Fixed classchange not clearing on unequip, fixed the mob's max hp not being updated on
	  class change [Skotlex]
	* Basic implementation of Taekwon's kicks. [Dralnu]
	* Likely fixed SP consumption of Warp Portal. [Skotlex]
	* Changed some default values in battle config to get the 'official gaming experience' by
	  default [DracoRPG]
	  - Noone can plagiarize advanced skills (from ragnainfo)
	  - No rare drop announce
	  - Riding a Peco does not increase one's size
	* Allowed Dispell to dispell songs/dances/ensembles [DracoRPG]
	* Updated SC IDs to get correct client-side status icons (used 0808 Sakexe) [DracoRPG]
	* Prevented from casting Ice Wall under self, independantly of UF_NOFOOTSET [DracoRPG]
	* Removed /omg from equipment breaking and added it to Acid Terror only [DracoRPG]
	* You can now change to Taekwon, but lots of things are still to do [DracoRPG]
	* Began implementation of Taekwon skills [DracoRPG]
08/21
	* Changed how triple blows/sacrificial ritual triggers to enable
	  plagiarizing them. [Skotlex]
	* Stolen items will be (un)identified using the same criteria normal drops
	  use. [Skotlex]
	* Updated yet again battle_check_target. Guardians should stop attacking
	  out of woe now and alchemist should be able to hit their mines. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed the map server going in an infinite loop if the connection breaks
	  while parsing packets from the char server. [Skotlex]
	* Mostly rewrote Battle Chant, should be almost like the official one now... [DracoRPG]
	* Added enums for skill units, makes the code really clearer (check skill.h) [DracoRPG]
	* Merged battle_calc_weapon_attack_sub and battle_calc_weapon_attack [DracoRPG]
	* Fixed Acid Terror WEP breaking rate thx2 ShAPoNe [Lupus]
08/19
	* More updates to battle_check_target, now you can't target any
	  ground-based skills that don't have a physical manifestation (ie:
	  Everything except traps and icewall) [Skotlex]
	* Fixed "for sure" battle_check_target when it comes to neutral targets. [Skotlex]
	* Removed pc_emotion, merged it with emotion. [Skotlex]
	  Usage: emotion emotion_number <, target>
	  - emotion number is the emotion's number (use e_* constants)
	  - target is 1-> player, 0-> npc. If ommited defaults to zero.
	* Updated code so that when a guild master joins the game, their guild
	  skills are automatically blocked for 5 minutes. [Skotlex]
	  (prevents avoiding the skill-lock by relogging)
	* Another update to battle_check_target, this time neutral targets should
	  work correctly (non allied/partied people who should be affected) [Skotlex]
	* More fixes to battle_check_target, skills should not hit yourself on
	  pvp/gvg now. [Skotlex]
	* Updated classchange to not change the class of bosses. [Skotlex]
	* Optimization/Fixes to battle_check_target, GrandCross should work now. [Skotlex]
	* Reverted Lupus's change on guild auras' max lv... Please double check your sources and
	  base yourself on kRO official website as much as possible, thanks. Link to kRO website:
	  http://guide.ragnarok.co.kr/GuildSystem.asp#ggg03 [DracoRPG]
	* Fixed passive mobs incorrectly setting the attacked_id when hit by pets. [Skotlex]
	* Rewrote battle_check_target. [Skotlex]
	  - Positive side-effects: offensive stuff won't hit your guildmates on gvg
	  (such as traps)
	  - Negative side-effects: Unknown, but there's bound to be some because of
	  the big change. I tested it with traps, spells, pets, passive and
	  aggressive mobs, but it's probable there's stuff I am still missing.
	* Updated mob spawns of Glast Heim (gl_sew3 and gk_knt2) [Skotlex]
	* Updated classchange code (Azoth, Heiroloist) to get random classes the
	  same way a dead branch does. Cannot convert to bosses. [Skotlex]
	* Script/Npc/Item updates. [Skotlex]
	* Bonus b(HP/SP)GainValue will always be considered 100% (the first
	  parameter) this is done to avoid exploits when combining it with
	  b(HP/SP)DrainValue (eg: Immaterial Sword) [Skotlex]
	* Fixed max level of some guilds skills 5->1 [Lupus]
		according to http://eathena.deltaanime.net/board/index.php?showtopic=757 
	* New items drops, new shop [Lupus]
08/18
	* Changed the way 'pl' works (in skill_db) : now 0 for 'weapon' attack skills means the
	  attack is always neutral. To make so that the skill takes the weapon's element, use -1
	  instead: this removes the need of hardcoded ele_flag. [DracoRPG]
	* Fixed damage bonus from Sage's elemental flooring skills by moving the checks which were
	  totally wrong placed... Thanks to Antoine for pointing out they were broken. [DracoRPG]
	* At the same time I had to change battle_calc_magic_attack quite alot. Maybe it won't work
	  perfectly, but at least it'll compile. Also added (forgotten?) support for 'skillatk'
	  bonus with magic skills. [DracoRPG]
	* Rewritten most of Gloria Domini to make it be a BF_MISC skill that can hit and damage
	  Emperium and plants (yes it does), igonres WoE damage adjustments and other changes I
	  don't remember ^^ [DracoRPG]
	* Modified mob_skilluse so that mobs NEVER use offensive heal. They'll now
	  /swt if they try it (and the skill fails) [Skotlex]
	  (there's still nothing that can be done about offensive Sanctuary)
08/17
	* Added script command pc_emotion, works just like emotion, except the
	  emotion is displayed on the character that's running the script. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed the vicious compile error I added with SC_SPEEDUP1 [DracoRPG]
	* Implemented Strengthen Guardians with a custom +10% ATK & ASPD / lv value [DracoRPG]
	  NOTE : It compiles, but I couldn't test the effect since guilds seem completely
	  broken on my test server...
	* Moved Weaponry Research hidden bonus a bit to get the exact effect [DracoRPG]
	* Implemented SC_SPEEDUP1 for Lightning Box effect [DracoRPG]
	* Entirely replaced SC_DIVINA with SC_SILENCE (the 1st was an alias of the 2nd) [DracoRPG]
	* Fixed the map-server disconnecting the char-server when kicking out all
	  clients. (Thanks to End of Exam for pointing it out) [Skotlex]
	* Cleaned up error messages related to packet parsing in the char servers. [Skotlex]
08/16
	* Likely fixed the char-server crashes on mapif_send* functions. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed auto-counter's display (it was working correctly, however the skill
	  was not being shown properly on the client) [Skotlex]
	* Fixed Tomahawk not being considered a ranged attack. [Skotlex]
08/15
	* Added a few bug fix recommendations [Codemaster]
	* Fixed a few problems with Wedding Skills [Codemaster]
	* Fixed a bug with old clients connecting and socket reuse which would kick
	  all new connections on the same socket before even checking the packet version. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed the tabs in the ayothaya mobs :X [Skotlex]
	* Likely fixed the setsocketops error that was showing on every connection. [Skotlex]
	* Updated vending code so that items that can't be traded can't be vended
	  either. [Skotlex]
	* Messed with socket.c, changing lots of stuff around using some earlier
	  Freya SVN version as base, connection issues might hopefully get better. [Skotlex]
	  (NOTE: I have yet to try to compile this under Windows/Cygwin, so report
	  if it breaks)
	* Updated Magnum Break: Target selectable, damage is (100+20*level)%, hit
	  bonus +10 per level. 5x5 splash area. [Skotlex]
	* Likely fixed the max hp display of tiny/big mobs. [Skotlex]
	* Updated Cloaking. It'll fail if the level is less than 3 and there's not
	  a wall nearby. [Skotlex]
	  If cloak_check is set to ignore walls, the wall-type speed will be used all
	  the time.
	  (I don't see what all the fuss is about as a Lv2 Cloak is just as good as
	  Hide, and you can't even use GrimTooth from it. And since lv2 won't let
	  you move anyway, why would anyone use Clock lv2 over Hiding?)
	* Updated Assumptio. It will affect anyone in a 3x3 area around the target. [Skotlex]
	  (where anyone is anyone the same way Benedictio chooses it's target)
	* Updated the delay that a mob can't move after attacking to be 1/4th of
	  the delay between attacks. [Skotlex]
	  eg: The mob attacks once every 1000ms, that means it can start chasing
	  you 250ms after an attack.
	* Likely fixed the #fakename crash. [Skotlex]
	* Updated the mob skill use code so that hopefully other players will be
	  considered friends when using support skills. [Skotlex]
	  NOTE: Not quite tested, use with care.
	* Fixed @monsterbig/@monstersmall [Skotlex]
	  Support for said monster in normal spawn scripts is also fixed, however
	  the implementation is not stable (currently you add 10K to the ID to make
	  it a tiny mob, add 20K to make it a big mob, but those values depend on
	  MAX_MOB_DB which can change in the future. :/)
	* When you drink a speed potion, the icon of the previous one will be
	  removed (however, all speed potions are still in effect server-side). [Skotlex]
08/14
	* Likely corrected the error printing in recv_to_fifo (reporting normal
	  disconnections when they likely are not). [Skotlex]
	* Fixed the map-server spamming "Client does not has latest EXE message. [Skotlex]
	* Updated char-sql to consider 0 an invalid map-server session number. [Skotlex]
	* Fix in map->char auth request packet where char server spams data search error message, currently in testing. But works none the less. [Kevin]
	* Removed all close()'s in clif.c, made clif_parse the only one who closes
	  a socket and deletes the session. [Skotlex]
	* Updated socket.c to be much more verbose about connections and when they
	  are ended. [Skotlex]
	  (excuse all the extra messages, but they are to help track down the
	  current map-freeze bug)
08/12
	* Updated sql-files: mob_db.sql, item_db,sql, main.sql [Skotlex]
	* Likely fixed mob reloading command. [Skotlex]
	* Added more reports and some fixes/optimizations to socket.c [Skotlex]
	* Added reporting of error when a connection can't be made non-blocking. [Skotlex]
	* Updated Logging Filter: [Lupus]
		- Implemented refine_items_log condition. You may log only certain refine value items.
		- Added 'log_steal' option. It'd log stolen items in the drops log DB
	* Added msg string and announce on stealing of rare items [Lupus]
08/11
	* Fixed bio-cannibalize's max hp issue. [Skotlex]
	* Pneuma completely blocks Soul Breaker (as the forum consensus says it
	  does so) [Skotlex]
	* clif_parse will now print the error message in case close(fd) fails. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed players clicking on players disguised as NPCs trying to execute the
	  "npc". [Skotlex]
	* Fixed possible overflows and exploits in log.c, thanks to Irmin [Skotlex]
	* Probably fixed devotion's visual not updating. [Skotlex]
	* Added flag pet_no_gvg, when set to yes/1 the pet is returned to an egg when
	  you enter Guild Grounds and you aren't allowed to hatch pets as well. Note
	  that it only does the check when the player changes maps (should be safe
	  because players are kicked out of castles when WoE starts)
08/10
	* Fixed PNEUMA blocking magic part of Soul Breaker, instead of physiacal attack one [Lupus]
	* Fixed the Login/Char SQL crashing when determining the max id of empty
	  tables. [Skotlex]
	  Account and Char creation code tested, it is safe to use now.
	* Removed use of settick_timer (fixes the "can't move!" bug) [Skotlex]
	* Fixed (I think) being able to sit while casting. [Skotlex]
	* Updated Char-SQL server to guarantee that new chars are created with
	  char_ids above 150K. [Skotlex]
	  (note from last update applies too)
	* Updated Login-SQL server to guarantee that new accounts (_M/_F reg) are
	  created with account_ids above 2M. [Skotlex]
	  (note it hasn't been tested yet, but I think it should work)
	* Fixed @readmail 0 [Skotlex]
	* Fixed success rates for Dispell and Decrease Agility [Skotlex]
	* Fixed cultivation not being in the list of skills for GMs with
	  gm_skill_all [Skotlex]
	* Fixed mob's hp becoming zero after mob_hp_rate adjustments. [Skotlex]
	* Skills update: [Skotlex]
	- Changed concentration from +10% hit per level to +10 hit per level.
	- Base level gives greater stun chance to Attack Weak Point (currently +1%
	  every ten levels)
	- Changed Tiger Knuckle Fist to be a combo-only skill.
	- Updated Spell break to damage 2% of target's max hp, heals half that.
	* Small debug change in clif.c which forces a disconnection upon dual-login [Skotlex]
	* Updated char-sql deletion to take into consideration the mysql version [Skotlex]
	  It should treat versions 4.1+ differently from the rest, please test and
	  report if it is still failing.
	* Removed sql loading of storage every time you open it as it's an open
	  exploit on lagging servers. [Skotlex]
	* Removed another "insufficient data" debug line. That should take care of
	  incomplete packets spamming the console. [Skotlex]
	* Alright, removed the "insufficient data" debug line as it was just
	  causing mass lag. [Skotlex]
08/09
	* Fixed Magnum Break's damage display. [Skotlex]
	* Finished fixing and testing the sql char deletion update. [Skotlex]
	  Deleted characters should now properly leave their party/guild.
	* Throw Stone is now blocked by Kyrie and Pneuma [Skotlex]
	* Fixed "[error] delete_timer error: no such timer -1" (stupid mistake x.x) [Skotlex]
	* Some modifications to char-sql char deletion, so that characters are
	  correctly removed from parties and guilds. [Skotlex]
	  (Note that this is yet to be tested, so upgrade at your own risk or if
	  you want to help file bug reports until I can get to test it on my own
	  later today)
	* Likely fixed Endure and the like not being 'disabled' on GvG grounds. [Skotlex]
	* More debug messages to clif.c (these can be ignored on normal situations,
	  but might be useful during freezes) [Skotlex]
	* Optimized the packet-version failed rejecting code. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed Freezer Card combo casting Weapon Perfection on the enemy. [Skotlex]
	* Added more information to the map-char connection process, meant to help
	  understand what is going on when things 'freeze'. [Skotlex]
08/08
	* Fixed players not really being disconnected when the char-server is out. [Skotlex]
	* Added check to resend map server connection packets if the connection to
	  the char server was established but the initial packets get somehow lost. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed Picky's pet-script being used for all pets... [Skotlex]
	* Fixed an ugly bug that was causing status-changes to crash the map server [Skotlex]
	* Added a timer to the map server. It'll try to reconnect 1 sec after it is
	  disconnected from the char server (in addition to the default "try to
	  connect every 10 secs" mechanism). [Skotlex]
	* Reverted Safety Wall to last known working state. [Skotlex]
	  (from what I read in the code, it should be crash-safe anyway)
	* Mob level up is now capped to max_base_level rather than 99. [Skotlex]
	* Another fix to Safety Wall :X [Skotlex]
	* Fixed Safety Wall (I think). Do test and pray it crashes no more. [Skotlex]
	* Added settick_timer to timer.c, optimizes status retimings for dance
	  skills. [Skotlex]
	* Made @autoloot and item_auto_get play along nicely (@autoloot toggles the
	  mode, item_auto_get sets the default state of it) [Skotlex]

08/07
	* Corrected the Payon Guild Flags [Codemaster]
	* Lots of debug message cleanup in clif.c which should make more clear the
	  why characters are being disconnected. [Skotlex]
	* Added OnAgitInit to the list of npc events executed on connection (it
	  will be executed only the first time it connects, thought) [Skotlex]
	* Fixed the exp bonus on pvp maps (it was set to +115%, not +15%) [Skotlex]
	* Updated skill_blown to avoid knocking back plants. [Skotlex]
	* Made the damage delay of the finishing blow the same delay before sending
	  a char clear packet, this might fix mob sprites being left there after
	  killed. [Skotlex]
	* More fixes to @autotrade
		(You still can't disconnect your autotrader by entering in the
		server again. And an autotrader rises map server usage to 70%+).
		 Started adding Freya's anti-bot thing [Lupus]
	* Quick fix meant to prevent crashes when targetting "ghosts" of already
	  dead mobs. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed Pneuma and Safety Wall crashing the server. [Skotlex]
	  (was caused by yesterday's skill upgrade not being... eh, complete)
08/06
	* Yet another @autotrade fix by irmin&Ultra. More fixes are coming soon 8)) [Lupus]
	* Pretty big change in the way ground skills are handled, meant to fix
	  possible segmentation faults. [Skotlex]
	  Report if you notice any ground skill got broken, as pretty much all of
	  them have been affected. 
	* Removed the data about packet_version 14 in the packet_db [Skotlex]
	  This could mean that version 14 never really existed, and all following
	  versions need to be shifted up (who decides how to call these versions?
	  they certainly don't come coded in the login packet. We should ask
	  Sara-chan, the awesome ex-eA dev who pwns us al with her packet finding abilities.). 
	  Note that no such changes have yet been decided other than removing version 14.
	* Updated Devotion/Sacrifice. AutoGuard and Defender skills are now kept in sync
	  between the Crusader and those Devoted. [Skotlex]
	* Added a battle_stopwalking to NPC_STOP effect [DracoRPG]
08/05
	* A li'l fix of @autotrade. Used some irmin's code and optimized a bit [Lupus]

	  Source used: http://guide.ragnarok.co.kr/jobmagskill.asp
	* Updated map_server sql so that the storage is loaded from sql everytime [Skotlex]
	* Updated the char deletion routine (sql) so that only the correct pets
	  will be deleted (those hatched and that are in the char's inventory/cart)
	  [Skotlex]
	* Likely fixed the map server spamming the console when clients gets
	  rejected due to packet version. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed the make_connection problem (sorry about that) [Skotlex]
	* Updated make_connection (socket.c) so that it actually returns -1 when
	  the connection fails. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed change-cart clearing other options. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed @spawn not working with string names. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed songs/dances not being moved when knocked back. [Skotlex]
08/04
	* Made mobs retaliate against a pet's master when for some reason a pet is
	  attacking a passive mob which is not yet attacking back. [Skotlex]
	* Modified the mob_db to make it a dynamic array of mob databases. [Skotlex]
	  This allows usage of high mob ids without wasting memory on large gaps of
	  unused mob IDS.
	  NOTE: Other than loading/unloading the map server, this has not
	  been tested, if it crashes DO report right away (preferrably with a
	  backtrace)
	* Bumped the MAX MOB ID to 10K [Skotlex] 
	* Added 2 new mobs, updated and added some items. Thanks to Landarma [Lupus]
	  Also fixed map-serv loading warnings (about wrong mob IDs)
08/03
	* Removed the clif_waitclose timer message, and placed it instead around
	  clif.c on the areas that are actually invoking the waitclose timer. [Skotlex]
	* Changed the "Player not identified with account id" message to be more
	  descriptive (however I don't know how much of the player data is available
	  when disconnecting this way, so if it crashes DO REPORT it) [Skotlex]
	* Modified @me so that it actually works as expected by IRC junkies. [Skotlex]
	  (tested and works correctly)
	* Updated Enchant Deadly Poison: Can't be dispelled, won't end when you are killed. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed draining more HP/SP than you can have [Skotlex]
	* Fixed enchanted peach tree damaging you when attacking the undead [Skotlex]
	* Removed the tick check from the packet_version guessing as it is an
	  unsigned int (so every value in said field is valid) [Skotlex]
08/02
	* The char server now notifies the map server about which is the max
	  account/char id available, this is used to help identify packet versions
	  more reliably. [Skotlex]
	* Guardians won't level up now with mobs_level_up=1 [Skotlex]
	* Updated Deluge, Volcano, Violent Gale & Land Protector to not require
	  gems when recasted, and the previous time remaining will be used instead.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Fixed Zeny from mobs. [Skotlex]
	* Changed the visual effect when pets heal status ailments to "Detoxify" [Skotlex]
	* Fixed "bonus2 bSkillAtk" so that it works with up to five skills [Skotlex]
	  (previously it only worked for one skill at a time)
	* Fixed Enchant Deadly Poison on normal attacks. [Skotlex]
	* Updated the packet-guessing code, trying to load negative char accounts
	  should be fixed now. [Skotlex]
08/01
	* Updated the login servers so that account registration can be done with
	  _m/_f as well as _M/_F [Skotlex]
	* Fixed login sql server not using md5sum on the passwords before creating
	  accounts (when md5 passwords are enabled) [Skotlex]
	* Updated Enchant Deadly Poison: Increases Sonic Blow's damage by 4x and
	  affects all skills except Breaker/Meteor Assault [Skotlex]
	* Added a check to prevent char-server freezes when receiving unknown
	  packets from the map server. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed some problems with the clif optimizations from earlier today (wrong
	  animations being displayed for normal attacks/picking items) [Skotlex]
	* Rewrote Ensemble skill implementation to be more efficient and less
	  error-prone [Skotlex]
	  (say, when you do an ensemble skill, your partner has to be
	  charged SP too? That is not the current case)
	* Dance/Song checks so that the ground effect is more tightly coupled with
	  the status effect (if the dance's effect is cancelled for whatever reason,
	  the ground skill WILL be removed) [Skotlex]
	* Fixed stat reset for Advanced Classes [Skotlex]
	* Updated Lord Knight's Concentration (damage, defense, endure effect) [Skotlex]
	* Likely fixed famous alchemist potion usage. [Skotlex]
	* Small optimization to the packet version guessing code. [Skotlex]
	* Added Warpparty and Warpguild script commands *requested* [Fredzilla]
	* Fixed the exp exploit bug dealing with expaddrace [Skotlex]
	* Added missing CharCommands logs (together with ATCommands) [Lupus]
		TODO: '/' commands 8)
	* Added mod for npc whisper system(lordalpha)[massdriller]
	* Added lordalfa's str1 and str2 compare and check commands [massdriller]
07/31
	* Fixed (I think) the char sql server freezing when the map server sends it
	  a GM whisper request. [Skotlex]
	* Rewrote the way that experience is given, this should prevent exp overflows
	  even in even-share parties. [Skotlex]
	* Changed how the exp_calc_type works, take note that there's no longer a "2"
	  value for it! [Skotlex]
	* Updated throw stone: Damage is modified by target's cards, 3% chance to
	  cause Stun/Blind. [Skotlex]
	* Added rods/books to the list of items that can't break. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed map server rejecting clients of packet versions 9 and below
	  (regardless of packet_ver_flag) [Skotlex]
	* Updated Steel Body: Consumes 50% sp and is not dispellable. [Skotlex]
	* Updated sprinkle sand's damage to 130%, Throw Stone's range and delay [Skotlex]
	* Fixed increased dodge's flee bonus and speed bonus (to Assassins). [Skotlex]
	* Simplified clif.c by removing all code related to hard-coded packet
	  information (the packet_db.txt is an essential file now) [Skotlex]
	* Small fixes to provide clarity to # commands 
	(So many people ask "why doesnt @char????? work, like OMGWTFBBQ") [Fredzilla]
	* Fixed a stupid typo in a drop rate display [Lupus]
07/30
	* Some more fixes to the job calculating equations. This one should fix item
	  usage for mounted classes and hopefully be the last fix needed regarding
	  the job system upgrade. [Skotlex]
	* Corrected the parsing/reading of the skill tree. This fixes the Priest/Monk
	 skills appearing in the skill trees of Paladings/Crusaders. [Skotlex]
	* Another fix about advanced/baby mounted characters not having skills. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed character's class not getting updated when mounting/dismounting peco. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed the default packet version checking in the guessing version code.
	  as pointed out by End of Exam. [Skotlex]
	* Optimized the code that determines what packet version to use by default
	  when you specify "packet_db_ver: default" [Skotlex]
	* Fixed job changing to high/baby classes [Skotlex]
07/29
	* Moved messages "One Castle", "Two Castles", etc into msg_athena.conf [Lupus]
	* Fixed wrong msg_athena.conf messages in the trade hack spoof code [Lupus]
	* Added a Rare Item announce string into msg_athena.conf [Lupus]
	* Fixed compilation of the TXT server. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed song/dances not clearing when you run out of SP [Skotlex]
	* Fixed #fakename [Skotlex]
	* Optimized Apple of Idun's implementation [Skotlex]
	* Updated pc_calc_base_job and related functions and applied them around
	  the map server. This should fix all item related problems with Super Babies
	  and alike. [Skotlex]
	* Simplified/optimized the code that mounts/dismounts from Pecos. [Skotlex]
	* Changed Create Deadly Poison to not use the item producing interface (works simplier,
	  like Aqua Benedicta) and added a separate config option to choose whether the maker's
	  name is written on the Poison Bottle [DracoRPG]
	* Changed NPC_STOP to immobilize the target during 2 seconds (from ragnainfo) [DracoRPG]
	* Added "cartboost" state to skill_require_db (used for Cart Termination) [DracoRPG]
	* Rewrote Soul Destroyer's damage dealing and displaying code, now everything is done at
	  once: no more people killed without damage displayed [DracoRPG]
	* Readded Assassin Cross not affecting bows [Skotlex]
	* Fixed Hip-Shaker (not tested, but I am assuming it works now) [Skotlex]
	* Fixed Brandish spear's damage [Skotlex]
	* Removed the after-cast delay of Recall Partner [Skotlex]
	* Added optional announce of rare drops. When a SomePlayer kills a monster [Lupus]
	  with a rare drop then everyone gets announce: 'SomePlayer' won Pupa's Pupa Card (chance 0.01%)
07/28
	* Fixed the Server Whisper to GMs in the char-sql server [Skotlex]
	  (when an exploit that should be notified to GMs is triggered, the map
	  server would just hang instead...)
	* Some code reorganization around the name-spoof exploit protection code. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed not being able to do Extremity Fist after Glacier Fist/Tiger
	  Knuckle Fist [Skotlex]
	* Likely fixed the Famous Alchemist potions not having that 50% boost. [Skotlex]
	* Updated the Wedding Skills (they work with 10% HP/SP and heal 10% of
	  their target's, summoning has a cast time of 20s) [Skotlex]
	* Reverted AssassinCross's song behaviour. [Skotlex]
	* Odd bug wanting all Account and Char IDs to end with 0?! [Codemaster]
	  Note: Not all acc or char ids end with 0...this gave alot of problems with client version 16
	* Fixed that compiling issue with buildin_getequippercentrefinery [Skotlex]
	* Updated Bard's AssasinCross (Impressing Riff) to not affect Bows (is this
	  how it really is?) [Skotlex]
	* Massive skills update (from now updated kRO website) [DracoRPG]
	  - Weapon forging, ore/metals refining, potion making : tried to correct rates ^^
	  - Weaponry Research : does NOT increase NPC equipment upgrading chance
	  - Skin Tempering : (4*skilllv)% fire resistance and (1*skilllv)% neutral resistance
	  - Hilt Binding : the original 'undropable weapon' part is dead
	  - Meteor Storm : (3*skilllv)% stun chance
	  - Lord of Vermilion : (4*skilllv)% blind chance
	  - Sandman : (40+10*skilllv)% sleep chance
	  - Ankle Snare : minimum trap time changed to (3+0.03*skill_lv) seconds
	  Tons of other skills could and should be reviewed the same way ! ^^
	* Fixed massdriller's fixes ^_^ [Kevin]
	* Some fixes to Whisper system. [massdriller]
07/27
	* Fixed the fame list packet mismatch bug. [Skotlex]
	* Even more cleanups to socket.c and chrif.c to prevent even handling
	  Session #0 [Skotlex]
	* Some more cleanups to chrif.c (the interface to the char server)'s code. [Skotlex]
	* Appied End of Exam's socket/connection related fixes/suggestions. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed a Segmentation Fault with friends list loading. [Kevin]
	* Fixed the npc whisper system. [Kevin]
	* Fixed most of the matrix bug, note to devs: Don't use tmp_output anymore! [Kevin]
	* Fixed a small compile warning with previous fix. [Kevin]
	* Added ATCommand @AutoTrade. You open a shop, setup your goods. Then use @AUTOTRADE.
	  Your will be closed, but your merchant would remain in the game. So you can vending
	  without your client ON. (originally by Fantik, changed by Lupus)
	* Added ATCommand @ChangeGM. Your Guild Master can set another GM of the guild.
	  Note: It works, but have to be optimized, WIP. (originally by Fantik, changed by Lupus)
	* Added lordalfa's npc whisper system [massdriller]
	* added lordalfa's fix/enhancement for Execute Scripts::labels [massdriller]
07/26
	* Updated the packet-version guessing code, hopefully it does a better job now [Skotlex]
	* Fixed the mob bug where they "stick to you" and won't let you escape [Skotlex]
	* Reverted mob skill usage rates. A rate of 1000 (in mob_skill_db.txt) IS 100% usage. [Skotlex]
	* Corrected Gospel not dissipating when you die. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed Providence/Resistant soul so it can't be casted on yourself-other crusaders [Skotlex]
	* Updated Quagmire to affect everyone in GVG maps. [Skotlex]
	* Small fix to the packet_version identification [Skotlex]
	  A more complete testing/verification code comes later...
	* Likely fixed the txt->sql converter. [Skotlex]
	* Corrected some refine success rates. [Skotlex]
	* Modified the packet client version guessing code (perhaps it more
	  accurately guesses the version now?) [Skotlex]
	* Fixed reading of 'repairitem' packet in packet_db -> fixes Weapon Repair [DracoRPG]
	* Rewrote Weapon Repair to allow use on other players [DracoRPG]
	* Moved pc_item_repair, pc_item_refine and pc_item_identify to skill.c [DracoRPG]
07/24

	* Fixed elemental modifiers not applying to skills. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed mob_ghostring_fix config. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed firewall stun-locking enemies that are not pushed back. [Skotlex]
	* Added some checks into MONSTER spawn command (reports wrong number, ID, delays, etc.) [Lupus]
	  - somehow it doesn't report about wrong map names yet
	* Added check for missing TAB characters into script parser [Lupus]
07/23
	* Fixed friend-saving on the new charsave sql method. [Skotlex]
	* Corrected the ghostfix description in battle_athena. [Skotlex]
	* Modified the Makefile to include FD_SETSIZE = 4096 when compiled under
	  Cygwin [Skotlex]
	* Added a check for max mob skill level (when reading mob_skill db) [Lupus]
	* More fixes/updates to the txt->sql converter of inventory/cart (will it ever work?) [Skotlex]
	* Fixed job_db2 reading [Sasuke]
	  Field count is MAX_LEVEL+1 since job ID is the first field of the 'split' table
07/22
	* Changed a bit the aspd penalty for dual-wielding assassins. [Skotlex]
	  The new factor is 2/3 rather than 0.7, which should be closer to what
	  rodatazone says, but also makes them dual wielders a bit slower :X
	* Fixed job_db2.txt reading so that it will read up to MAX_LEVEL job bonuses. [Skotlex]
	* Changed the way the OS is detected in socket.h [Skotlex]
	  This MIGHT fix the current 60 user limit problem.
	* Fixed characters not being able to attack and getting "there is a delay
	  after a skill" messages instead. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed status changing cards not taking effect. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed packet_ver_flag reading. [Skotlex]
	  (previously, if you tried setting it to 256 or 512 it would be
	  resetted back to 255, which would cause problems with the later clients)
	* More fixes to the txt->sql converter. Does it works now? [Skotlex]
	* Added water height values of Ayothaya, Ayo_dun02, sec_in02 maps (thanx 2Lorky) [Lupus]
	* Fixed char-sql memo saving. [Skotlex]
	* Added the wantoconnection packet of version 13 to version 14 [Skotlex]
	  Note that this will cause all ver13 clients to be identified as v14, it
	  WILL cause problems if you use ver13 clients. There is no easy way around
	  this as both versions seem to use the identical login packet. If you
	  want to give preference to v13 over v14, you can specify the default to
	  be it.
	* Fixed Encore skills working when the partner has no weapon equipped. [Skotlex]
07/21
	* Fixed the fame lists, they work now. [Skotlex]
	* Rewrote the friends system, it now works. [Skotlex]
	  Sql users upgrade with the 2574.sql upgrade, txt users will have to
	  wipe their friends.txt (there's no easy way to convert that one).
	* Fixed the txt->sql converter not converting inventory/card. [Skotlex]
	  The friend conversion was removed due to the new structure.
	* Restructured some of the logic behind auto-attacks and normal attacks
	  which should prevent most speed-hacks and be more responsive to players. [Skotlex]
07/20
	* Updated the txt->sql converter, I THINK it will work now. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed Plagiarized skill's level not being saved. [Skotlex]
	* Changed Pressure/Gloria Domini to take a % of current SP, not max SP (from a post on
	  ragnainfo, not personal custom shit! :p) [DracoRPG]
	* Removed debug messages for fame list and signaled the bug that causes problems [DracoRPG]
	* Removed the need of job_db2-2 (advanced jobs' stat bonuses) and moved its use to
	  job_db2 [DracoRPG]
07/19
	* Reorganized the way sql chars are being saved. [Skotlex]
	* Merged battle options player_combo_damage_delay and
	  mob_combo_damage_delay into combo_damage_delay [Skotlex]
	* Some code reorganization that hopefully should help with mobs not having
	  the same damage delay on the client and within the server. [Skotlex]
	* corrected some bounds errors in the new packet_db code 
	  that was corrupting memory [MouseJstr]
	* Corrections to Tiger Knuckle Fist [Skotlex]
	* Rewriting of part of the skill-additional effect code. (Should fix
	  Asura's penalty) [Skotlex]
07/18
	* Added a check that might prevent sql char crashes when requesting info
	  for non-existant Characters. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed main.sql (start char_id should be 150k) [Skotlex]
	* Some code-cleaning for Sacrificial Ritual [Skotlex]
	* Optimization of auto-triggering skills (double attack, sacrifice, triple
	  blows) [Skotlex]
	* Small fix to Sanctuary (shouldn't start healing until after 1.5 secs of
	  casted) [Skotlex]
	* Implemented Palm Strike (you cast the skill, it pushes back the enemy and
	  deals damage 1 sec after it was casted) [Skotlex]
	* Rewrote and tested Gospel's code, currently it works as follows: [Skotlex]
	  Offensive Effects:
	  0: Defense ignoring damage 1~9999
	  1: Curse enemy
	  2: Blind enemy
	  3: Poison enemy
	  4: Lv10 Provoke
	  5: Def, Def2 to 0
	  6: Base Atk, Watk to 0
	  7: Flee to 0
	  8: Speed/Aspd -25%
	  
	  Deffensive Effects:
	  0: Heal 1~9999
	  1: End all negative status effects
	  2: Lv10 Bless
	  3: Lv10 Inc Agi
	  4: Aspersio (holy weapon)
	  5: Benedictio (holy armor)
	  6: +100% max hp
	  7: +100% max sp
	  8: +20 to all stats
	  9: +25% def (armor and vit)
	  10: +100% base atk
	  11: +50 flee
	  12: +50 hit
	  13: Status effect inmunity
	- Effects have a chance of 10*Skill_lv% of triggering every 5~15 secs 
	  for whoever is on the skill area.
	- Report any modifications/corrections needed on the forums.

	  servers somehow got their chars to start from id 1 instead of 150k. [Skotlex]
	* Added a bunch of debug information to help me understand why the client
	  version check is failing. Report back the output on the forums. [Skotlex]
	* The memory manager is now OFF by default [Skotlex]

	* Updated Louyang monsters spawn (thanks to MasterOfMuppets) [Lupus]
07/15
	* Rewrote most of the packet_db handling code. [Skotlex]
	  eA now really supports multiple packet versions at the same time,
	  (so that transitioning from one packet version to another should be
	  smooth), there is no longer any need to mess with the db/packet_db.txt
	  file.
	* The values for packet_ver_flag have changed, check the battle_athena
	  comments and set it up accordingly!
	* Using the packet_db is the only way to manage packets now. [Skotlex]
	* Added sql runservers to all branches as runserver-sql.bat [Evera]
07/14

	* Adjusted my fix of buildin_getequipisequiped to not leave
	  the return stack tweaked [MouseJstr]
	* Changed skill_unit_onlimit to use strncpy instead of memcpy
	  in one spot to eliminate accessing unallocated memory [MouseJstr]

	  [MouseJstr]
	* increased max maps per server to 1024 [MouseJstr]
	* Added check into buildin_getequipisequiped to make sure arguments
	  don't go outside of array boundries *crash* [MouseJstr]
	* Add a check into refine bonuses to not go outside of array
	  boundries if somebody has a wlv above 5 in the database *crash* [MouseJstr]
	* Modified skill_tree code to confirm we are still inside the 
	  skill_tree array before accessing a element from the skill_tree
	  array *crash* [MouseJstr]
	* Changed the mob spawning code to use strncpy instead of memcpy
	  in some places to avoid copying unallocated and uninitialized 
	  memory *crash* [MouseJstr]
	* Fixed the compile problem on the previous upgrade. [Skotlex]
	* Changed refine success chances to match jRO information. [Skotlex]
	  See http://tomcat1.s13.xrea.com/bs/calc.html and
	  http://eathena.deltaanime.net/board/index.php?showtopic=39997
	  for the details on the new equation.
	  (changed because the current equations seem somewhat outdated)
	* Fixed max chance const of "mob skill usage". Now all mobs aren't hyperactive. [Lupus]
	* Fixed global vars not being saved instantly (used to cause some scripts exploits) [Lupus]
	  Need some offensive testing.
07/12

	* Changed Guild auras to not be removed by Dispell (they came back when you walked
	  anyway :p) [DracoRPG]
	* Changed the default for equip_natural_break_rate to 0 (official) [DracoRPG]
	* Fixed the function that checks whether the player has valid equipment for his buffs :
	  don't return once one buff is stopped, since there can be more (e.g. Crus' shield buffs
	  will now ALL be stopped when the shield is unequipped, not only Guard ^^) [DracoRPG]
07/10
	* Fixed Alchemist Fame system using' account_id' instead of 'char_id', however this does
	  NOT solve the names problem : I left debug messages so you can see by yourself that the
	  bug comes from map_charid2nick that always returns null... [DracoRPG]

	  But the skills don't work yet (I tested)
	* Massive mapflags fix. Also added there Novice Guilds. [Lupus]
07/08
	* Fixed below fix xD [DracoRPG]
	* Added another sql injection fix [Kevin]
	* Rewrote part of the name request code [Skotlex]
	  This means that now you can see other people's party even if they don't
	  belong to a guild, and the party/guild names are updated whenever someone
	  joins/leaves them. Not fully tested but works alright on the client I use
	  (0411)
	* More Adoption skill fixes. [Skotlex]
	* Added the Adoption skills to all classes [Skotlex]
	  They should be auto-granted upon adoption (and are not resetable,
	  learnable). This, of course, needs testing, do report if it does not
	  works. (those that already have someone adopted will need a custom npc to
	  give them the skills).
	* Reverted Wedding Rings as they don't need to give the adoption skills
	  anymore [Skotlex]
	* Added script command getchildid() [Skotlex]
	* Updated wedding rings to give the adoption skill when equipped. [Skotlex]

	  tux/wedding dress since that resets their size. [Skotlex]

	  (Adrenaline Rush was chosen because it's animation does resemble a
	  'curative spell')
	* Changed all SQL-related error messages to use ShowSQL [Skotlex]
	  ShowSQL now is also printed on the stderr (like ShowError and ShowFatalError)
	* Beautified the output of the char server (sql) [Skotlex]
	* Modified Dispel so that it can fail. [Skotlex]
	  As I have no information of how mdef protects against it, the current
	  dummy equation is: (50+10*SkillLv - mdef)% (note that mdef2 is not used!)
	  If someone knows the actual equation, do open a bug report.
07/06
	* Fixed Spider-web (works like a ground-targeted trap) [Skotlex]

	  (was working incorrectly and causing memory leaks)
	* Another mob-ai fix, this time mobs should unlock their target once
	  it has died for sure. [Skotlex]
	* Added player_combo_damage_delay & monster_combo_damage_delay [Skotlex]
	  See battle_athena.conf for description of how they work.
	  Defaults to 0 because it is not yet tested for an appropiate default.
	* Removed player_damage_delay & monster_damage_delay [Skotlex]
	  Use player_damage_delay_rate:0 & monster_damage_delay_rate:0 instead.
	* Set item_use_interval to 0 (official default, isn't it ?) [DracoRPG]
	* Improved appearance of script-errors reported during loading. [Skotlex]

	* Some items, monster drops fixes [Lupus]
07/05
	* Fixed double attack damage [Skotlex]
07/04

	* Added lordalfa's edit where Labels from Event Monsters be executed using the MVP RID, 
	  and not the Last Hit guy RID. [massdriller]
	* Added lordalfa's PCBaseUpEvent script event command. to trigger, type in 
	-[TAB]Script[TAB]PCBaseUpEvent[TAB]-1,{
	 YOUR CODE HERE;
	}
	the script should run everytime the user gains a level. [massdriller]
	* Fixed Job Quests exploits (Advanced Classes were able to pass their 2nd job quests again) [Lupus]
	  High Novices were able to pass Super Novice Job Quest as well. They weren't able to GET those
	  professions, tough. But there were some items exploits.
	  Now Advanced classes get reborn guides from all main Job Quest NPCs (1st, 2nd Classes)

	  (but not yet finished) [celest]
	  - To activate it just edit plugin_athena.conf
	  - When running just access http://<your server IP>:<your server port>. The
	    default home page is httpd/index.html, you can edit it if you want.

	* On Guild_skill table corruption in SQL: this is a problem with

06/19

	  written by Athena it is neccesary for the SQL server which 
	  automatically handles it. Else each char may have only 1 item 
	  in a given table. [Aru]

	  behavior, you can comment out the new line for it in 
	  skill_db.txt [Aru]

	  option, default: off [Aru]

	* Added mob_clear_delay option to battle_athena.conf.
	  Can add a delay before sending monster death packet (time is in milliseconds and default 0 is off).
	  Increasing this can fix the problem with monster sprites still appearing after it died.  Recommended value: 10. [Valaris]
	* Fixed spawning multiple sized monsters via scripts. [Valaris]
	* Added LittleWolf's mode 256 (0x100 internally) for monsters (adds detect hidden to a monster, doesn't have to be an MVP, demon or insect). [Valaris]

	  - You will only need the plugin if you are using a gui program like wxOAGUI
	    to run Athena
	  - To configure it check addons/gui.conf
	  - Passing "--gui" as a parameter, i.e "./map-server --gui" will activate it
	    as well (GUI program creators, you should handle this transparently)
	* Added get_uptime to timer.c -- used by @uptime and the 'sig' plugin [celest]
	* Merged the 'uptime' plugin into 'dump' and renamed to 'sig' -- it'll now
	  handle both crash and uptime logging [celest]

	  (works only on non-modified guild tables previous the new guild system)
	* Small nullpo fix on @where.

	  the two will be used on the currently equipped weapon.
	* Dec Agi now cancels Cart-Boost and viceversa as explained by Ishizu [Skotlex]
	* Cloaked characters now can't pick items. [Skotlex]

	* Fixed the overflowed valstr free on skill.c:8840 [Skotlex]
06/11
	* Lord Knight's Beserk now cancels all the caster's other 
	  self-buffs when used. It also cannot be re-used during the
	  no-SP-recovery penalty period after it expires. (This penalty 
	  will now cancel on your death however.) [Aru]
	* Reverted the previous stacking type for aspd as per rodatazone
	  information [Skotlex]
	  Speed modifiers, however, still stack on the new way as there's been
	  complains of characters reaching impossibly high walk speeds.
	* Modified bAspdAddRate code so that it stacks linearly. [Skotlex]
	* Changed default stacking type for skill modifiers [Skotlex]
	  If you have +50 aspd and +50aspd you won't get 100% aspd, instead now you
	  get 50% of the 50%, that is 75% aspd bonus. Changed meant to protect
	  against stacking skills to get impossibly high walking speed/attack
	  speeds.
	* Modified the way bAspdRate & bSpeedRate work. [Skotlex]
	  They are meant to be non-stackable, so only the card/equipment with the
	  highest bonus prevails.(items with stackable bonus should use
	  bAspdAddRate & bSpeedAddRate instead.)
	* Changed the DoppelGanger Card definition from bAspdRate to bAspdAddRate
	  to make it stackable. [Skotlex]
	* Capped walkspeed at 4x default [Aru]
	* Added Maeki's awesome convert_guild_tables.sql
	  You must still manually add the `char_id` field to the `guild`
	  table and fill it with the guildmasters' char_ids BEFORE
	  running it. [Aru]
	* Removed inter_guild_storage_delete calls from int_guild, 
	  innodb tables make it unneccessary [Aru]
06/10
	* Updated the default pet_db.txt support values	[Skotlex]
	  We don't have an official list of the support rates, but 1% as default
	  (1.5% if they have max intimacy) is just ridiculous.
	* More map server memory cleanups... (70%) [Skotlex]
	* Fixed that crash upon login.... 	[Skotlex]
	* More map server memory cleanups...  (45%) [Skotlex]
	* More map server memory bound cleanups and checks (35%) [Skotlex]
	* Fixed Stalkers being able to use (plagiarized) ground-target
	  skills from Chase Walk

	  mini-bosses (mode & 0x20) in battle.c
	* Added battle_config option item_use_interval with default 500ms [Skotlex]
	* Started map server memory bounds checking for overflows (20%) [Skotlex]
	* Small optimizations on ensemble skills [Skotlex]
	* Fixed some compile warnings on char-sql server [Skotlex]
	* Added script function getitemslots(item_id);	[Skotlex]
	* Fixed a bunch of script functions generating a new dummy item instead of
	  failing when the item was not found.	[Skotlex]
	* Fixed mobhp display so that it will be displayed no matter which /showname option a player is using. [Valaris]
	* Fixed names with disguises (I tested it. It works. No more bitching. :P). [Valaris]
	* Completely overhauled SQL guild code to use innodb type tables
	  unfortunately, old guild tables are not compatible.
	  If you don't mind the data loss, wipe your current guild 
	  tables and run guild_tables.sql to create new guild tables. 
	  [Aru and CuteBoi]
	* If you want to manually convert your old guild tables, you'll
	  need to add the foreign keys from guild_tables.sql to the 
	  databases. And add the `char_id` field to the guild table.
	  Its value needs to be the char_id of the guildmaster [Aru]
	* Added 'alchemist' mob skill condition [celest]
	* Rewrote most of the old jA Self Destruction code [celest]
06/09
	* Fixed a possible null_po in clif.c:7714 caused by lagged clients [Skotlex]
	* Fixed enemy damage_delay being modified by 400 instead of 100. [Skotlex]
	* Changed behaviour of map_freeblock/map_freeblock_unlock as the previous
	  way seems to cause memory leaks. [Skotlex]
	* Tidied up code relating to skill_get_inf2() [Skotlex]
	* skill_db.txt updated. New inf2 values:	[Skotlex]
	  16: Guild skill, 32: Song/Dance skill, 64: Encore skill
	* Other misc arrangements to skill_db.txt (see db/Changelog) [Skotlex]
	* Tidied up code relating to skill_get_nk()	[Skotlex]
	* Readded the previously removed skills from item_db [Skotlex]
	* getpetinfo(2) will return "null" on no pet. [Skotlex]
	* Tidied up code relating to skill_get_inf() [Skotlex]
	* Some small fixes to @grind, @useskill [Skotlex]
	* Added fist (bare hands) to the list of unbreakable equipment in
	  pc_break_equipment	[Skotlex]
	* Reestructured battle_config options for equipment breaking [Skotlex]
	  Removed equipment_breaking and added equip_self_break_rate,
	  equip_skill_break_rate. Read battle_athena.conf for more info.
	* Fixed getpetinfo(2) crash. [Skotlex]
	* Added a couple missing lines from my PSIBlade merge of disguises. Name, attacking 
	  and such are fixed now with disguises. [Valaris]
	* Added battle_config option to set if advanced job skills may be plagiarized
	* Fixed ASC_BREAKER to ignore race/size/element cards like it should
	* Changed @fakename so it no longer needs to teleport the client to work [celest]
	* Removed the old day/night system that uses the blind effect [celest]
	* Fixed day/night cycles with darkness_level on not refreshing properly [celest]
	* Fixed pc_follow_timer cancels if the player or the target warps [celest]
	* Added @follow on the same target for the 2nd time will stop following [celest]
	* Added Memory manager will perform a hash check when freeing memory, by
	  End_of_exam / jA 1213 -- fixes crashes when a pointer created by level 2 ALLOC
	  is passed to level 1 aFree
06/08
	* Updated idle time considerations. [Skotlex]
	  A character's idle time is reset upon: Walking, attacking (auto-attack
	  counts too), using a skill or using a item.
	* idle_no_share changed from a Yes/No setting to # of seconds before
	  considering character idle (no/0 still disables). [Skotlex]
	* Updated idle_no_share description in battle_athena.conf
	* Modified @disguise so that it will always work with Npc/Mob names and Mob
	  Ids. Only npc by id is hardcoded for now.	[Skotlex]
	* Added atcommands cleanmap, npctalk, pettalk to atcommand_athena.conf with their
	  description.	[Skotlex]
	* Fixed spawn delays for anthell eggs	[Skotlex]
	* Removed equipment_breaking, use equipment_break_rate = 0 instead.
	  [Skotlex]

	  Komurka [Skotlex]
	* GM used Type 11 items will be exempt from the "GMs can do whatever they
	  want" rule regarding skill_usage because otherwise the used item is never
	  consumed.	[Skotlex]
	* Fixed Ice Falchion/Firebrand giving skills, they just cast the spell [Skotlex]
	* Reduced Ice Falchion's freezing chance from 5% to 1% [Skotlex]
	* Added Makefile caching [celest]
	  'Makefile.cache' is created when you compile for the first time, and keeps
	  all your makefile definitions so it can be read directly when you recompile,
	  instead of redetecting things one-by-one.
	  'Make [char_sql/login_sql/map_sql]' will now work properly too.
	  NOTE: A cache file created by compiling txt is NOT compatible with SQL, but
	  a cache created by SQL is compatible with TXT! Delete the cache file first
	  and compile SQL before TXT if you have to.
	* Skills will reset at level down. [davidsiaw]
06/07
	* Temporary change of the way mob memory is removed when they don't have a
	  respawn time (check for memory leaks fixed after killing all summoned mobs)
	  [Skotlex]
	* Fixed map_quit being called twice when a player requests to change char [Skotlex]
	* Fixed compile issues on various versions of linux 
	  (please avoid inline in include files until we offically go
	   over to being a c++ app)  [MouseJstr]
	* Fixed aFreed messages of double freeing sd->reg and sd->reg_str [Skotlex]
	* Re-fixed sql-files/item_db.sql [Skotlex]
	* Plagiarism won't work if the skill to be copied killed you. [Skotlex]
	* Removed use of 'l' as prefix for temporary variables. [Skotlex]
	* Updated max hair styles in battle_conf to 23 [Skotlex]

	  - Added Cannibalize & Marine Sphere summoned mobs will use their owner's name
	  - Added clean up player info when switching characters
	  - Added reinitialise storage when char server disconnects
	  - Changed some cloaking/chasewalk checks
	  - Fixed memory leak when map cache reading has an error
	  - Fixed a bug when receiving member info for an empty guild
	  - Skip still connecting players in clif_foreachclient()
	* Weather will now properly appear/disappear without having to refresh the client. [Valaris]
	* Complete monster disguise re-code: [Valaris]
	  -No more client crashes in PVP caused by disguises.
	  -Can view own attack/hit/cast/sit/turn animations.
	  -Monster sprite syncs up better than before.
	  -Fixed stat dupe exploit with disguises.
	  -Fixed crashes that prevented peco riders with disguises.
	  -No more refreshing of the screen when equipping/unequipping disguises.
	* Fixed crashes caused by Graffiti Cleaner. [Valaris]
	* Added following missing checks to Ensembles: [Valaris]
		-Partner's equipment is an instrument.
		-Partner is alive.
		-Partner is not casting another skill (This allowed dance floor panel duping).
		-That both people are in a party (before if both partner's were in no party (party ID 0) 
		 it would allow them to use an ensemble.
06/06
	* Fixed and updated sql-files/item_db.sql to match with the current
	  db/item_db.txt	[Skotlex]
	* Removed variables with prefix "l" being treated as a temporary
	  variables by the scripting engine.	[Skotlex]
	* Updated description of idle_no_share battle_config option	[Skotlex]
06/05
	* Added more debugging information to login-in characters to track down the
	  authook nullpo problem.	[Skotlex]
	* Added a temporary string length check on trade-request.	[Skotlex]
	  (reports seem to indicate that the map-server garbage text bug could be
	  related to trading string length overflow, check the map-server output
	  for "name too long" messages).
	* Fixed a few Visual Studio compile errors and warnings - not completely fixed [Codemaster]
	* prevent_logout is now overriden by dead characters.	There's no point in
	  waiting 10 secs since you were killed to quit/change character. [Skotlex]
	* Passive mobs will now unlock their target once it's dead/gone too
	  far/in another map.	[Skotlex]
	  Passive mobs are supposed to be defensive, not vengeful. Do report of any
	  abuses that might be possible from this to take proper measures.
	* Fixed pet lures always failing (oops) [Skotlex]
	* Corrected Various Jur's (id 1264) equip script to bonus2 [Skotlex]
	* Fixed status_get_speed always returning 1000 when invoked on NPCs [Skotlex]
	* Added battle_config option pet_support_min_friendly [Skotlex]
	  Specifies minimum pet intimacy/friendly value needed before attacking.
	  Default 900, see battle_athena.conf for more information.
	* Some reorganizing of pet-catching code	[Skotlex]
	* Now mobs will do the /ag emotion when you use a lure on them and they
	  can't be caught (wrong lure, or mob not in the mob_db.txt).	[Skotlex]
	* Fixed a timer mismatch situation with pc_walk timers [Skotlex]
	* Re-structured the pc_follow_timer code	[Skotlex]
	* Updated the pet_heal_timer code to match behaviour with
	pet_supportskill_timer's one	[Skotlex]
	* Added support for universal lure. [Skotlex]
	  Use use_script "pet 0;" to create an item that will catch any non-boss
	  mob (will work as long as said mob has an entry in mob_db.txt, of course)
	  From what I read in the code, mapping multiple entries in mob_db.txt to
	  the same egg_id should work, so it should be possible to have all mobs as
	  pets using a single egg_id item and this custom lure.
	* Updated Weapon Repair from jA 1228 [celest]
	* Fixed TXT char disconnecting when sent a server packet from SQL map [celest]
	* Fixed login failing with md5 encryption, thanks to End_of_exam
	* Fixed lock_fclose() failing in Win32 builds, thanks to End_of_exam
	* Updated sql-files/mob_db.sql to match with db/mob_db.txt	[Skotlex]
	* Corrected Zherlthsh's and Alice's attack animation speed (mob_db.txt)	[Skotlex]
	  sql-users can use upgrade_svn2068.sql to update table mob_db.
	* Re-fixed disp_hpmeter not getting disabled when set to 0/no	[Skotlex]
	* Fixed Grandcross/DarkCross to do 3 hits instead of 4 [Skotlex]
	* Fixed #fakename =). [Kevin]
	* Tidied up and rearranged Makefile a bit [celest]
	  - added 'make [common/map/login/char] options' -- only for txt though ^^;
	  - readded sse, mmx and o3 optimisation flags (disabled by default) -- you'll
	    have to edit and enable them yourself
06/04
	* Moved @charchangesex to #changesec *still disabled*. [Kevin]
	* Fixed a major security hole in the mail system, thanks to Valaris for the info =). [Kevin]
	* Moved @charsk/stpoint to #sk/stpoint. [Kevin]
	* Moved @charmodel to #model. [Kevin]
	* Moved @charst/skreset to #st/skreset. [Kevin]
	* Re-updated sql-files/item_db.sql to use price buy/sell NULL instead of 0	[Skotlex]
	  The file is full of REPLACE instead of INSERT, so if you already have the
	  structure of the table right, you can just delete the table definition
	  and apply the file to update your item_db table.
	* Commented out char_athena.conf. [Kevin]
	* Moved @charlostskill to #lostskill. [Kevin]
	* Moved @charquestskill to #questskill. [Kevin]
	* status_change_start will halt silently instead of printing null_po messages
	  when trying to apply  status effects on pets	[Skotlex]
	  (Fixes null_po's from pets doing magnum break and who knows what other
	  skills)
	* Moved #showexp and #showdelay to @showexp and @showdelay. [Kevin]
	* Moved @charjoblvl and @charbaselvl to #joblvl and #baselvl. [Kevin]
	* Readded the cloth dye packet upon-walk. Sorry about that [Skotlex]
	* Fixed Party Exp Even Share	[Skotlex]
	* Added #fakename, due to popular demand =)[Kevin]
	* Clothe dye is updated now on view_class change	[Skotlex]
	  Most noticeable effect: Dye is not lost un unequipping a tuxedo/wedding dress.
06/03
	* Updated sql-files/item_db.sql to match with the current db/item_db.txt [Skotlex]
	* Added some initialization code regarding dynamic mobs during map startup. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed the typo on Thief's Sling Stone quest (Zargon->Garlet)	[Skotlex]
	  Why noone fixed this before? o.O
	* Removed a piece of code that updates your cloth's dye whenever you walk.
	  I have been testing for a bit, and this piece of code seems unneeded, and
	  not only that, it causes quite a bandwidth penalty by sending
	  dye-changing packets every time every character walks!	[Skotlex]
	  If you get reports that the characters are getting displayed their
	  default color instead of their selected dye, report it so I add back that
	  piece of code (but it would be best if we could do without it, it would
	  save quite some bandwidth).
	* Some compiler fixes in older versions of GCC, thanks to esca.
	* Some optimizations to petskill_use	[Skotlex]
	* Fixed the default max hair dye color count, it is 8, not 9 @.@	[Skotlex]
	* Changed disp_hpmeter's behaviour so that you can disable it by setting it
	to "no" or 0.	[Skotlex]
	* Fixed gm chat kick protection.	[Skotlex]
	* 'Tidied' a bit party_exp_share (more like restructured it).	[Skotlex]
	* Re-added party_idle_no_share code. When was it removed? [Skotlex]
	* Added skills going damanage when PVP isn't on fix. [Kevin]
	* Fixed the party-even-share bonus for large parties. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed gm chat kick protect.[Kevin]
	* GM of higher or equal level can use @where on another GM.[Kevin]
	* Fixed @fakename command.[Kevin]
	* Stopped the map-server from invoking "OnAgitStart" each time it connects
	to the char server.	[Skotlex]
	* Modified Abracadabra code to make it work with Pet Skills	[Skotlex]
	  (Warning: Not yet tested)
	* fixed a bug with Abracadabra
06/02
	* fixed compile issues on older gcc, thanks to esca [Shinomori]
	* Added @size and @fakename gm commands. [Kevin] 
	* Added valaris's getstrlen and charisalpha functions into the script parser. [Kevin]
	* Added clif_guild_xy(_remove), rest needs to be added somewhere. [Kevin]
	* Fixed items lost on shutdown/crash, by valaris. [Kevin]
	  -Note: Was partially finished by massdriller =).
	* A few things: [Kevin]
	  -Fixed valaris's gms can't be kicked function.
	  -Added battle_config option for valaris's function.
	  -Added battle_config option for gms can join password protected chats of valaris's .
	* Moved "readme"'s and other non important files into doc/notes/ [massdriller]
	* Cleanup in chat.c, party.c, storage.c [celest]
	* Fixed an inconsistent message for log_chat in conf file reading [celest]
	* Fixed mob class changing not checking array bounds, by Shinomori
	* Fixed mob summoning slaves not checking array bounds, by Shinomori
	* Updated max packets in clif.c [celest]
	* Fixed some compile time warnings.	[Kevin]
	* Added GM chat kick protections, thanks to Valaris [massdriller]
	* Added Password protection chat rooms access to gms, thanks to Valaris [massdriller]
	* Fixed a couple of things in map.c, thanks to Valaris [massdriller]
	* Storages now saves upon closing, thanks to Valaris [massdriller]
	* exp share and added zeny share/party bonus exp thanks to Valaris [massdriller]
06/01
	* Fixed Divest Shield and Divest All not able to strip shields [DracoRPG]
	* Changed the default max_hitrate to 100% as specified in rodatazone [Skotlex]
	* Removed the console messages printed when the script command getmapxy is
	  invoked	[Skotlex]
	* Fixed non-droppable items blocking the client from further droping 
	  other items	[Skotlex]
	* Changed the default of mob_remove_delay to 5 mins	[Skotlex]
	* Changed the minimum mob_remove_delay to 15 secs since mobs with instant
	  respawn actually take 5~10 secs to respawn	[Skotlex]
	* Fixed again disp_hpmeter, it looks like this time it works properly. [Skotlex]
	* Added Esca's fixes to make eA properly compile under Sun-OS	[Skotlex]
	* Tested and fixed script function getnameditem	[Skotlex]
	  Now you can use getnameditem(item,char) to get inscribed equipment (only
	  works with what you can equip, arrows excluded). The item description can
	  be the item id or the item name, and the character can as well be the
	  character id or character name. Function returns 1 if successful and
	  the character who's name is to be inscribed HAS to be online.
	* Changed the way dynamic mobs are removed. Now all mobs have are tagged as
	  either cached/uncached, and only those cached are removed	[Skotlex]
	  Mob-Slaves are the only non-cached enemies that are also tagged as
	  cached.
	* Fixed a delete_timer mismatch in pet.c	[Skotlex]
	* Fixed some compile time things in older versions of gcc. [Kevin]
	* Removed the clif message when you can't drop items [Skotlex]
	  Apparently this message breaks the clients and prevents further drops of
	  items? Might need further testing.
	* Changed AspdRate and SpeedRate bonuses so they can stack [DracoRPG]
	* Added script function getnameditem	[Skotlex]
	  syntax: getnameditem itemid, inscribed char's name
	  Needed at least for wedding scripts. Only works on equippable items,
	  returns 1 on success, always makes only 1 item.
	  (it should also be able to use char's id or item's name instead)
	  Script function proof-read but not yet tested, so it might have a bug or
	  two, use at your own risk for now.
	* Fixed dynamic mobs removing Guardians [Skotlex]
	* Fixed sql queries in logs giving an error. [Kevin]
	* Fixed @memo ignoring the nomemo map flag, thanks to Maeki. [Kevin]
	* Enabled an account flood protection system defaulting to 1 account every 10 seconds. [Kevin]
	* Corrected dynamic mob unloading to remove slaves. [Skotlex]
	* Added Maeki's fix for handling the sql connection to the log server [Skotlex]
	* A reminder to people who seem to have a broken item_db (wrong item
	  sprites, doing nothing on click, etc): there was an update to item_db
	  some days ago, a new column which is used to determine refineable 
	  items (which goes between eLv and View) The shipped item_db.txt is
	  already updated, but if you have custom files, you can try updating
	  them using the gawk line (further below this changelog) or this short
	  sed command (from within the db directory):
	  gsed -re 's/([^,]*,){16}/&,/' < item_db.txt > item_db.fix
	  And then replace item_db.txt with the newly created file (if ya don't
	  have gsed, try sed. All *nix should come with one or the other, and you
	  can also get it with cygwin)
	* Moved the dynamic mob spawns/deletes to map_addblock/map_delblock [Skotlex]
	  This pretty much guarantees that mobs won't be spawned/deleted twice from
	  the same map.
	* Added random's battle_config flag for enabling/disabling dynamic mobs [Skotlex]
	  Dynamic mobs is good for medium to small servers, but on large ones it
	  gets to be somewhat pointless.
	* Fixed disp_hpmeter, I think (can't test it, but the code looks ok) [Skotlex]
	* Added battle athena option mob_remove_delay [Skotlex]
	  Now dynamic mobs are not removed inmediately, but after some time has
	  passed. Default value is 60 secs
	* Added debugging information about dynamic mobs [Skotlex]
	  Helps keep track of how many mobs are being removed/spawned, use it to
	  track any possible bugs! Should be removed after dynamic mobs are good
	  enough.
	* Some changes to dynamic mob unloading to avoid remove summoned mobs and
	always remove mob slaves.	[Skotlex]
	* Fixed a nasty pc.c bug thanks to komurka [massdriller]
	* Added Sasuke's modification to allow certain gm levels to see the 
	  hp bars [massdriller]

		You can use this query to "Clear nice save point of all jail/unjail abusers friends"
		SQL QUERY: update ragnarok.char set save_x = 0, save_y = 0 where (save_map = 'prontera.gat' and save_y = 191)

        * Fixed a typo in Volcano, thanks to Ilpalazzo-sama [celest]

03/06
	* Added new anti-hacker trade protection from Freya. [Lupus]
	  It also auto-ban hackers and broadcasts messages to all GMs. Good work, Yor!
	* Misc fixes. [Lupus]
	  2Shino: BTW Some players can't re-connect to the server. Due to the updated session checks in chrif.c
         actually impossible, because the checks handle the connection with the char server, not with users
         anyway, I checked again and rearranged code but functionality is still the same and valid [Shinomori]
03/05
	* Reversed drop_rate0item option, corrected MVP Drop rate (thanks to Freya) [Lupus]
03/04
	* Fixed SQL Guild Castle Saving (now fully working, tested on 100 players during WOE) [Lupus]
03/02
	* Fixed SQL Guild Castle Saving (partial, yet it doesn't clear GuildID when you abandon a castle) [Lupus]
	  + added 2 fixes by POW (Mac Guild Position fix, Max Guild Members fix)
	* Fixed Emotion Flood (by Yor) [Lupus]
        * SQL: Fixed temporary ban. Now banned players can enter the server when the ban time is over. [Lupus]
	  It wasn't working because STATE hasn't been cleared properly.
	  Also fixed wrong client messages (ban reasons: Banned by GM / Temp ban till DATE).

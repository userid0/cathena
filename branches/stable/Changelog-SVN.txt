	  - nojobexp - on killing a monster you don't obtain Job EXP at all (including MVP EXP bonus)
		nobaseexp+nojobexp=noexp

	  - noloot - on killing ANY monster you get no loot at all
	  - nomobloot - on killing a common monster you get no loot at all
	  - nomvploot - on killing a MVP monster you get no MVP loot at all
		nomobloot+nomvploot=noloot

05/12
	* Very very very strong weapons (forged with 3 Star Crumbs) now give +40 dmg
	  instead of +15 dmg [DracoRPG]
	* Weapons/potions made by a top-10 famous player now give bonus effects [DracoRPG]
	* Updated the battle.c change made to generate compile time
        errors if you put the wrong battle_config option with the
        wrong type into the wrong place [MouseJstr]
	* Added item type 11 into LOGs filter [Lupus]
	* Removed mob_skill_use, if you don't want mobskills, set mob_skill_rate to 
	  zero [Skotlex]
	* Modified drops_by_luk behaviour. See battle_athena.conf for details [Skotlex]
	  The new system works a lot like Diablo 2, where having 100% better chance
	  of finding items means that you basicly get double drop rates than others.
	* Implemented pet idle skills restrictions as explained by Komurka [Skotlex]
	  From what I was told, a mob can only cast a skill while in idle state
	  once, and it needs to move before it can do another idle-state skill.
	* Tested and fixed wedding_ignorepalette, it now works as it should [Skotlex]
	* Tested the new item type 11. I forgot to add the code for the sql
	  version, but that's now fixed and the new system works as it should [Skotlex]
	* Put a fix in for the bug mentioned below [MouseJstr]
	* Added code to make min_hair_style, max_hair_style, min_hair_color,
	  max_hair_color, min_cloth_color, max_cloth_color work [Skotlex]
	  What it does, is cap the values whenever you try to change the
	  character's dye via an npc/script, it won't touch character's dye colors
	  upon loading.
	* Shrinked @mapinfo output, added 2 missing flags NOWARP / NOWARPTO [Lupus]
	* New item type (11) to item_db: delay-consumed usables. [Skotlex]
	. All items that have in their script "pet" or "itemskill" must be changed
	  from type 2 to 11. The new type of item has the property of not being
	  consumed on double click, but after a target is selected (hence it is
	  ideal for lures, skill-casting items and the yggdrasil leaf)
	  The item_db.txt file was updated to reflect these changes. Custom pet 
	  lure owners, update!
	  SQL users can run upgrade_svn1705.sql which will upgrade both item
	  databases (including all custom lures)
	* Added battle config option 'ignore_items_gender'. [Lupus]
	  So any player can equip any item regardless of the gender restrictions.
	  Note: It's ignored by default since gender check isn't implemented at
			official servers.
	  There are 2 exceptions: Wedding Ring M/ Wedding Ring F (their gender check
	  won't be affected)

05/11
	* Added by popular demand battle config options mob_skill_rate & 
	  mob_skill_delay. See battle_athena.conf for further information. [Skotlex]
	* Added battle config option wedding_ignorepalette (default no)
	  When enabled, the wedding dress/tux will always display with the default
	  dye (not all palette packs bring palettes for the wedding class, nor
	  they should) (Needs testing)
	* Changed most battle_athena options to unsigned short. This means the
	  maximum valid value is around 60K (65535 on most systems) which 
	  translates to ~60 secs or 600% (600x) for most options. See 
	  conf-tmpl/battle_athena.conf for details on which variables were
	  excluded (exp/drop rates values are excluded, obviously).
	* Removed boss warping code since it is currently supported by the mob skill DB
	  'rudeattacked' state [celest]
	* Fixed plagiarised skills replacing actual learnt skills [celest]
	* Fixed 'gmcommand' script command crashing when no players are attached [celest]
	  ... which means the command does not work in script events like OnClock!
05/10
	* Added code to prevent pet lures from being wasted until after selecting a
	target (only works with official lures). [Skotlex]
	* Added MAX_REFINE to status.h [Skotlex]
	  Enables for custom max refine levels using the success rates in
	  refine_db.txt, npcs will know they reached the max level when the success
	  chance returns 0. (npcs still need updating to support this model)
	  - Note: Whitesmith's refinery skill might need to be tweaked if you want
	  them to be able to forge above lv10 and up to whatever custom max you
	  wish.
	  - Note2: Npc's refine_sucess script command ignores this max.
	* Skill updates [celest]
	  - Fixed Charge Arrow not requiring bows
	  - Fixed Enchant Deadly Poison working on bosses
	  - Fixed Concentration (again! xD) def penalty, thanks to UniRing
	  - Added code for NPC_REVENGE
	* Added 'masterattacked' mob skill condition [celest]
	* Added battle_config.use_statpoint_table [Skotlex]
	  When set to no, a new equation is used to calculate stat points after a
	  reset. I've tested the equation to death, so it should work flawlessly.
	  Advantages of using the equation: No need for statpoint.txt (it is still
	  read for the time being), and stat changes through npc buyers/sellers are
	  preserved after a reset.
	* Restructured clif_parse_Wanttoconnection [celest]
	* Fixed packet version detecting not working properly if last version's connection
	  packet is the same as the DB but with different values [celest]
	* Added built-in support for 2005-05-09aSakexe and changed 'packet_ver_flag'
	  default in battle conf to 511 [celest]
	* Added load local resnametables.txt into memory instead of opening and reading
	  it every time we look for a file [celest]
	* Fixed crash if resnametables.txt was not found in a grf [celest]
	* Removed some unnecessary steps in grf file lists loading [celest]
	* Added display_hallucination for clients where the effect lags badly [Skotlex]
	* Added the battle_config options for managing the pet-skills system [Skotlex]
	* Incorporated the new pet attack/skill system. [Skotlex]
	  See db/pet_db.txt for explanation, or visit 
	  http://www.eathena.deltaanime.net/board/index.php?showtopic=29918 for
	  details and support.
	* Fixed Marionette skill. Now you can't target other Clowns or Gypsies [Lupus]
	* Fixed all Hunters traps to affect Players in PVP/GVG places only. [Lupus]
	  And Shockwave Trap doesn't work on monsters, because they don't have SP

	    To load extra GRFs (if you have custom ones for your server for example,
	    or to load weekly kRO gpf's) just add as many 'grf' commands as you want

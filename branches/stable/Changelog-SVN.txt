Date	Added
==========
2005/11/03
	* Updated the code to allow the Emperium to be inflicted by Pneuma and
	  Safety Wall. [Skotlex]
	* Updated @recallall to revive any dead characters before moving them,
	  should fix that weird ghost bug. [Skotlex]
2005/11/02
	* Made Spell breaker not be able to cancel Pressure/Gloria domini [Skotlex]
	* Another fix/optimization to thenight/day system. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed possibility of freezing / stunning already frozen/stunned players
	- Now you can't froze an already frozen one [Lupus]
	* Fixed non-GMs allowing send trade requests from far places [Lupus]
	* Fix of lowest_gm_level (inter_athena), now logins with access under
	  lowest_gm_level overides gm_can_drop_lv. [Kayla]
	* Spell Breaker now works on any skill with a cast time. [Skotlex]
	* Made Dispell not work on Meltdown and Cart Boost [Skotlex]
	* Made Meltdown not dispellable upon death. [Skotlex]
	* Probably fixed Warp Portal [Skotlex]
	* Fixed players being able to mute others even if their gm level is not
	  high enough to use @mute [Skotlex]
	* Fixed Dispell not clearing a lot of status changes it should. [Skotlex]
	* Corrected the way the Emperium skill-defense works. Damage skills other
	  than Gloria Domini, Raging Trifecta and Gravitation do no damage. Status
	  changing skills have no effect, and normal heal heals for 0. [Skotlex]
	* Some more corrections to the night/day system. [Skotlex]
	* Multiple fixes to the skill system. Should fix Warp Portal, Teleport and
	  mob skills crashing the server. [Skotlex]
	* Updated sql-files/item_db.sql with the latest. [Skotlex]
	* Some optimizations to the script config events loading/storing/saving.
	  (Somehow it fixes the warning from the memory manager on shutdown...)
	  [Skotlex]
2005/11/01
	* Updated battle_check_target to allow ground skills that affect "Everyone"
	  to affect the emperium, only the ones that target only enemies will have no
	  effect. [Skotlex]
	* Changed the default of mob_max_skilllv from 11 to 100, as many of the
	  recent mobs use higher level skills. [Skotlex]
	* Moved the check which made emperiums receive 0 damage to: [Skotlex]
	- status_check_skilluse, so that all targetted skills fail.
	- battle_check_target, so that all ground-based offensive skills fail.
	* Cleaned up a bit the skill related code. [Skotlex]
	* Updated @ commands. NO command comes at gm-level 0 by default now, that's how
	  it should be, the new default minimum is 1 for most trivial @ commands. Also added
	  a bunch of commands to conf/atcommand.conf which were missing. I STRONGLY
	  recommend everyone to at least fetch the new atcommand file as there
	  were abusable commands at level 0 (abusable in the sense they can incur
	  performance penalties if over-used by everyone) [Skotlex]
	* Fixed crash when a mob was killed while under Rich Man Kim effect by a
	  non-player, also fixes Rich Man Kim not giving the correct exp bonus.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Modified the socket subsystem to not close all connections on an "Service
	  Temporarily Unavailable" error (it is a non-fatal error which basicly means
	  "try again later").  [Skotlex]
2005/10/31
	* Fixed all players having the "plant" mode on... [Skotlex]
	* Added a timer to delay the automatic respawn of characters in gvg or pvp
	  grounds. The delay is currently 1 second, but be warned that because of
	  this it may be possible to revive the character if some priest is insanely
	  fast as there's currently no way to "prevent" a character from being
	  resurrected. [Skotlex]
	* More and more new quest skills! :3 [DracoRPG]
	* Removed the setting where characters could logout overriding the
	  prevent_logout setting if they were dead (it made it extremely easy to
	  accidentally log out if you were killed while trying to escape) [Skotlex]
	* Changed prevent_logout from yes/no to a "duration in ms" setting.
	  Defaults to 10secs (10000ms), note the client always says "wait 10 seconds"
	  regardless of the value of this setting. [Skotlex]
	* Moved the status change of SC_RIDING/SC_FALCON from clif_changeoption to
	  pc_changeoption which correctly makes the falcon/riding states end on quit.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Mob ai fix (mobs locking down into one target forever even if they should
	  be able to change targets) [Skotlex]
	* Added routine to check party share level whenever one of the members
	 levels up. It's checked on the map server, and then a share request is sent
	  to the char-server if party_share_level is broken. [Skotlex]
	* Corrected "show drain" to show nothing if the leeched values are
	  non positive. [Skotlex]
	* Probably fixed Wand of Hermode not blocking the caster from walking.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Applied Silent's fix to @where [Skotlex]
	* Code cleanup regarding sign/unsigned comparisons. [Skotlex]
	* Updates to new quest skills, some are fully functionnal, some half, some
	  not at all xD. [DracoRPG]
2005/10/30
	* Fixed a bug that broke pet skills. [Skotlex]
	* @follow: Now to stop following, you may just type @follow, thx2Sartory [Lupus]
	* Fixed & finished what I did yesterday with SCs and quest skills, thanks
	  to Silent. [DracoRPG]
2005/10/29
	* Reorganized SC IDs to make room for 2nd jobs quest skills statuses: upped
	  SC_SENDMAX to 300 and moved all required SC to 300+. BEWARE: as a side-
	  effect of this, you might get 'glue boots' if an SC was saved and cannot
	  be restored because the ID isn't used anymore, this should only happen
	  with bonuses from cooked foods & dances/songs (unlikely since they last 20
	  seconds only), and maybe a few other such things. Simply remove lines
	  with SC IDs above 200 in your sc_data file/table. [DracoRPG]
	* Changed a bit the way Plant Cultivation fails: when it fails because of
	  missing items, it does nothing and displays "Skill had failed"; when the
	  50% success rate test fails, the effect is displayed but no plant summoned.
	  How should it work exactly? Because previous way was a bit confusing for
	  the player, not explaining why it failed, so I'd like to know. [DracoRPG]
	* Changed food cooking success rate to unmodifiable 50%, temporary value
	  waiting for accurate data ;) [DracoRPG]
	* Fixed the code in skill.c so that skills are considered as guild skills
	  (for things such as inf, maxlv, etc) only when their ID >= 10k, enables
	  use of 2nd jobs quest skills with 1k+ IDs, thanks to Silent. [DracoRPG]
	* Fixed the Flag guild script. Now one can only flag in using the flags infront 
	  of the castle. [Kayla]
	* Removed most of the built-in zlib files and the LOCALZLIB compile option
	  Note: All native Windows builds now require zlib1.dll, you can just download
	  it from http://www.zlib.org and place it in the main directory [celest]
	* Changed the unzip library to be static linked instead of dynamic [celest]
	* Small fix to the trading routing, should fix items with the no-trade flag
	  being able to be vended. [Skotlex]
2005/10/28
	* Fixed the size of the equip_job field in SQL item_db/item_db2, thanks to
	  blackhole89. [DracoRPG]
	* Harmonized the way NPC events such as PCLoadMapEvent, PCBaseLvUpEvent, etc
	  are implemented. Caution, now PCLoadMapEvent NPC is called globally: it
	  is not needed to put it in a specific map. Use script functions to know
	  which map the player has been warped to. Thanks to Z3RO. [DracoRPG]
	* Fixed the names of the job level up char commands. [Skotlex]
	* Tiny change to the script engine which may fix those crashes. [Skotlex]
	* Added blocking use of skills while sitting. [Skotlex]
	* Implemented Trancid's expanded global announce system. [Skotlex]
2005/10/27
	* Applied Ilpalazzo-sama/Zzo's patch that cleans up and fixes some bugs
	  with the script engine. [Skotlex]
	* Made land protectors from enemies cancel each other out. [Skotlex]
	* Made it so Guardians/Emperiums with no owning guild can be attacked out
	  of woe. [Skotlex]
	* Corrected being able to attack and use skills during the first interval
	  of Petrify [Skotlex]
	* Fixed packet exploit that allowed you to produce multiple times without
	  first triggering the skill. [Skotlex]
	* Cleaned up/simplified the implementation of SC_NOCHAT [Skotlex]
	* Added file upgrade_svn3746.sql, use it to alter your `char` table column
	  "manner", which should NOT be unsigned (if your column already is
	  signed, then no need to apply this update) [Skotlex]
	* More code cleanup to make eA ANSI-C compliant. [Skotlex]
	* Some fixes to the night-day-system. [Skotlex]
2005/10/26
	* Some more multi-map server work. It seems to work now correctly and with
	  no memory leaks, however it likely needs more testing. Also added the
	  support into the char-TXT server. [Skotlex]
	* Patched a crash where mobs with no space for looting would attempt to
	  loot. [Skotlex]
	* Updated mapflags, readded gvg_dungeon. Now mapflags work according to
	  this post: [Skotle]
	  http://eathena.ws/board/index.php?showtopic=58201
	* Likely fixed Party Even Share. [Skotlex]
	* Added map flag "nightenabled", only maps with this flag will display the
	  night effect when it's night. Said maps are specified in mapflag/night.txt [Skotlex]
	* Modified map flags gvg and gvg_dungeon. gvg now is basicly the same as
	  pvp, except guilds are automatically teamed up, while gvg_dungeon was
	  removed and replaced by gvg_castle, which is the flag now used for castle
	  maps which only modify the behaviour during WoE times. [Skotlex]
	* Updated the login/char TXT Makefiles so the TXT_ONLY flag is passed, this
	  SHOULD fix the guild size mismatch errors... [Skotlex]
	* Probably fixed a char-server crash related to whispers. [Skotlex]
	* Updated the custom jobmaster so it should stop second advanced classes
	  from being able to re-change jobs. [Skotlex]
	* Implemented dynamix's night system which uses a status change rather than
	  the "darkness levels", said config option removed as is no longer needed.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Some fixes to the char-sql code when sending chars to another map server.
	  [Skotlex]
	* LuzZa's ported Trade/Vending additional antispoof checks [Lupus]
	- thanks to Yor&Freya Team. So LuzZa is our new dev (it was his 2nd test)
2005/10/25
	* Some work fixing up multi-map servers. It should now *work*, however each
	  time the player swaps map-server it triggers all the relevant
	  on-login/on-logout events, which likely needs to be corrected at a later
	  date. Only SQL has been updated so far, TXT is still pending. [Skotlex]
	* Updated GrandCross so it does half damage on the caster (+half damage
	  from Faith, it does just 25% or less damage to self now) [Skotlex]
	* Updated battle_check_target to consider normal mobs as always belonging
	  to the same party (should fix them fighting out when pkmode is on)
	  [Skotlex]
	* Fixed the Makefile for TXT char/login servers (fixes guild structure size
	  mismatches) [Skotlex]
	* Added script command "playerattached", returns the char_id of the player
	  currently attached to the script, 0 if there's no player attached (or
	  attached player is no longer on the map server) [Skotlex]
	* Fixed @changegm in the char-txt server. [Skotlex]
	* Some code cleanup to make eA ANSI-C complaint (not quite there, but
	  closer) [Skotlex]
2005/10/24
	* Applied Ilpalazzo-sama/zzo's patch that optimizes the status_get_*
	  functions. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed changegm (as far as I know) [Skotlex]
	* Modified again the code that checks who and what can target traps. It
	  should be set to only let heaven's drive, arrow shower and remove trap
	  target them. [Skotlex]
	* Breaker now ignores mdef. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed script command "makeitem" to only require an attached player if the
	  map is defined as "this". [Skotlex]
	* Updated battle_check_target to enable only skills with inf 32 (can target
	  traps) to hit traps. Implementation may not be perfect depending on how
	  the client reacts to the associated skill_db change. [Skotlex]
	* Cleaned up battle_weapon_attack. [Skotlex]
	* Some optimizations to the struct mob_data. [Skotlex]
	* Applied Ipalazzo-sama/zzo's memory optimization patches. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed some quests and updated item_db. [Kayla]
	* Updated Grimtooth to cause "Stop" on enemies instead of slow down. The
	  duration used is now skill's time 2. [Skotlex]
	* Updated the mob_ai code so they do nothing if they were attacked but
	  can't attack back (and it did not invoke a rude attacked, that is,
	  monster_ai does not has 2 set) [Skotlex]
2005/10/23
	* Some fixes to @charmountpeco [Skotlex]
	* Some cleanups to pet.c, fixes pet_timer being invoked when the pet is
	  idle. [Skotlex]
	* Added a clause to ignore name solve requests of chat-rooms (for some
	  reason the client requests them...) [Skotlex]
	* Updated sql-files/item_db.sql to the latest. [Skotlex]
	* Removed that mob_spawn_once message that is just a debug message with no
	  real purpose anymore. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed forging displaying success even when it fails. [Skotlex]
	* Changed main.sql so that sc_data only has indexes, not a primary key
	  (I keep hearing mysql can't handle a triple column PK...) [Skotlex]
	* Fixed Doublecast's success chance [Skotlex]
	* 'Fixed' the warning on @reloadscript (just removed the warning and
	  avoided memory leaks, because properly unloading the user functions and
	  reloading them I could not get done) [Skotlex]
	* Fixed possible crash due to custom packets, thanks to Andz for the info.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Fixed mob's Scream/Frost Joke crashing the server if the message was too
	  long [Skotlex]
	* Fixed the wrong attribute being passed to the attribute fix in
	  battle_calc_magic attack (strange deja vu feeling.. I am sure I fixed this
	  same bug before).  [Skotlex]
	* Fixed trading. [Skotlex]
	* Removed Mastery damage being applied to Grand Cross [Skotlex]
	* Some more fine-tuning of the Grand Cross equation. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed mobs that couldn't attack not being able to use skills (first half
	  of why marine spheres were broken). [Skotlex]
	* Updated summoned marine spheres so they can move (second half of why
	  marine spheres were broken). [Skotlex]
	* Rewrote the produce system for mixed foods creation [DracoRPG]
	* Small changes and optimizations to battle_calc_magic_attack, replaced redundant
	  magic_subrace with missing magic_addsize, updated crappy doc about it [DracoRPG]
2005/10/22
	* Modified Finger Offensive's formula to be 100% + 50%*skilllv which seems
	  to be a more factually correct equation than what is shown in the websites.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Applied Ilpalazzo-sama's patch which speeds up the data zeroing in
	  status_calc_pc. [Skotlex]
	* Crashfix on invalid lines when reading castle_db.txt [Skotlex]
	* Updated GrandCross's damage formula according to Komurka's information.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Also, now skills that ignore card modifiers only ignore the attacker's
	  card modifiers, no the target's (does not apply to skills like Pressure
	  that do fixed damage). [Skotlex]
	* Updated Bowling bash damage, knockback to current Kro values. [Skotlex]
	* Modified NPC_EMOTION and NPC_EMOTION_ON so they can be used to modify the
	  current mob's mode (instead of setting it). [Skotlex]
	- Some examples:
		1269,Clock@NPC_EMOTION_ON,attack,474,1,10000,0,30000,yes,self,always,0,6,4,300,,,
	  Adds mode 4 (aggressive) for 300 seconds to Clocks when attacking.
		1193,Alarm@NPC_EMOTION,chase,197,1,200,0,5000,yes,self,always,0,19,4,10,,,
	  Removes the aggressive mode (4) from Alarms when chasing for 10 seconds.
	- After a mob's mode is changed, their state is reset so they can stop
		chasing/seek a target.
	* Made GrimTooth be longranged, Soul Drain work only on targetted skills,
	  and Extremity Fist only checks for enemy state right before attacking (I am
	  not sure it is 100% as it should be still, though) [Skotlex]
	* Eh.. now Safety Wall blocks all skills tagged as short-ranged. Report any
	  anomalies this causes. [Skotlex]
	* Added support for global mob skills. In essence, you can now specify a
	  mob skill that is added to ALL mobs in a single line by using negative
	  class IDs. -1 adds the skill to normal mobs, -2 adds the skill to
	  bosses, and -3 to both. For example:
	  -1,All@AL_HEAL,any,28,10,10000,500,5000,yes,friend,friendhpltmaxrate,60,,,,,,
	  Adds Heal Lv10 to all normal mobs.
	* Readded the level up buff bonus from the Taekwon class T.T [Skotlex]
2005/10/21
	* Removed the level up buff bonus from the Taekwon class T.T [Skotlex]
	* Small change in mob_ai_sub_hard which may fix mobs casting their Rude
	  Attacked skill when they shouldn't. [Skotlex]
	* Moved the code so that SNovice Steel Body should trigger inmediately upon
	  death, and bypass the exp loss penalty. [Skotlex]
	* Added Taekwon boy to the buff on level up system. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed Skills checking for water-cells instead of Land Protector cells.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Added config option skillrange_by_distance, makes skills be long/short
	  ranged based on the source/target distance. Defaults to 6 (mobs + pets).
	  [Skotlex]
	* Fixed Magic Power totally messing up matk. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed Meteor Storm [Skotlex]
	* Some changes to Moonlight Petals, it should make the skill finally be
	  considered an ensemble skill. [Skotlex]
	* Updated skill_split_atoi to guess linear increases up to half of the data
	  provided. This means it can understand the more complex cast times of
	  skills such as Meteor and Soul Strike. If you provide the data of ten
	  levels, then it will check for patterns up to 5 steps long (meaning that
	  the diff between 1 and 6 is the same as the diff between 2 and 7 and so on,
	  and if they all match, the tested pattern is applied all the way to level
	  100) [Skotlex]
	* Some modifications to Magic Power, it should hopefully be working now. [Skotlex]
	* Cleanups and fixes to Tarot Card. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed a screwup in skill_split_atoi which was corrupting the skill db. [Skotlex]
	* Free up block chunks allocated by the memory manager when shutting down [celest]
	* Updated packets in packet_db and clif.c [celest]
2005/10/20
	* Turned on the error_log by default (had this been on before, I would had
	  noticed why Longing for Freedom was not working several WEEKS ago >.<)
	  [Skotlex]
	* Fixed Longing for Freedom [Skotlex]
	* Hopefully fixed even-share party on char relog exploit. [Skotlex]
	* Modified Land Protector so it behaves more like Basilica. [Skotlex]
	* Removed GM account reading from the char-sql server and moved it into
	  the login-sql server (Ancyker requested this was fixed... and this is how
	  it was working on the TXT servers) [Skotlex]
	* Modified skill_split_atoi so it can guess linear changes in the values
	  and fill out the rest of the array correctly (eg: blowcount is defined as
	  1:2:3:4:5, now the function can understand that and fill the rest of values
	  with 6:7:8:9:10 and so on. It can also understand two-step increases, if
	  the value is 1:2:2:3:3:4, it can guess that the following values should be
	  4:5:5:6:6:7:7 and so on). This allows mobs to cast stuff like Thunderstorm
	  LV67 without the need of manually updating the dbs with the corresponding
	  values :O [Skotlex]
	* Fixed monster_ai&1 doing the opposite of what it should do. [Skotlex]
	* Rewrote the skill unit reiteration code so that it'll work with any AoE
	  skill that is set to not reiterate in skill_unit_db.txt, when no
	  reiteration is set, the skill cannot be stacked with itself, but it can
	  be placed on top of other AoE skills (except for Pneuma, Safety Wall,
	  Warp Portal, Basilica and the Hunter traps who all have their own checks
	  hardcoded) [Skotlex]
	* Modified the way Magic Power works for AoE magic skills, it should now
	  work correctly for all AoE spells including Meteor. [Skotlex]
	* Added mode "change target" (0x200 = 512) to specify mobs that can change
	  target while attacking. Since no mob in the db has been updated yet to
	  include this mode, for the time being all aggressive mobs will also be
	  considered as "change target" types (which is how eA has been managing it
	  up to this point) [Skotlex]
	* Added a check in status_check_skilluse to make AoE skills fail if the
	  caster is standing on Basilica. [Skotlex]
	* Reduced a bit the size of the party structure. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed Play Dead [Skotlex]
	* Reverted a memory fix in script.c which causes a crash.. [Skotlex]
	* Reverted a small change which likely made magic power not work anymore on
	  ground skills. [Skotlex]
2005/10/19
	* Added an SQL update update_logs2.sql Use it for more effecient work of your MySQL server [Luups]
	* Likely fixed Root and the Wedding Skills [Skotlex]
	* Fixed that crash in skill_use_id.. oops. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed demonstration triggering status effects. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed ground placed skills causing skill_counter_additional_effect
	  triggering on the skill's owner. [Skotlex]
	* Added corrections/checks that should prevent the char servers from
	  crashing if they parse a packet from a client where the session data is
	  expected to be but is not set. [Skotlex]
	* Converted NPC_STOP to a status-inducing effect, SC_STOP which prevents
	  characters from moving. [Skotlex]
	* General checks and cleanup (new function pc_can_move) to prevent chars
	  from walking when they shouldn't be able to. [Skotlex]
	* Some changes to int_party, which may prevent crashes due to large parties
	  in congested situations. [Skotlex]
	* Software Caused Connection Abort errors should inmediately terminate the
	  connection now (rather than waiting for the timeout) [Skotlex]
	* Hopefully fixed Basilica by making battle_check_target use the mapcell
	  instead of the status change when deciding the enemy state. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed being able to enable NPC clicks while a trading window is open. [Skotlex]
	* Added status change SC_MODE which allows to temporarily override a mob's
	  mode. It can be invoked through mob skills NPC_EMOTION and NPC_EMOTION_ON
	  using the second and third value (new mode and duration in seconds,
	  respectively). Example:
		1269,Clock@NPC_EMOTION_ON,attack,474,1,10000,0,30000,yes,self,always,0,6,133,300,,,
	  Makes the Clock do the /an emotion, and his mode changes to 133 (can
	  move, can attack, aggressive) for the following 300 seconds (if the mode
	  is 0, then the mode is not changed).
	- Note that when a mob gets their mode changed, their state is reset (so
	  they stop attacking/chasing)
	- Because of this update, the code that made mobs give up chasing after a
	  while is no longer needed and hence, removed.
	* Implemented function status_check_skilluse which checks whether a skill
	  (or melee attack) can be used on an enemy based on their status (restricts
	  skills that may be used if opponent is cloaked/hidden, or blocks Aex
	  Aeterna if opponent is petrified/frozen, blocks skills while silenced, etc
	  etc). Note that the code simplification/modification is big, so beware of
	  any new bugs that might have been caused by the function. [Skotlex]
2005/10/18
	* Fixed card set bonuses for sure this time (or so I hope) [Skotlex]
	* Fixed the Dissonance song bug which allowed you to cast a song afterwards
	  and it would not follow you around. [Skotlex]
	* Modified the counting function to never count in skills (traps, AoE
	  skills) since traps were always being counted in for stuff like Napalm
	  beat/Blitz Beat/etc. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed Devotion/Sacrifice check which should enable recasting on
	  characters. Thanks to Irmin for pointing it out. [Skotlex] 
	* Fixed offensive heal so it fails if not used on an enemy (instead of
	  failing when used on an ally). [Skotlex]
	* Modified the char servers so they do a party range check when a character
	  logs in. This should fix parties keeping their even share even after a
	  low-level member rejoins the server. [Skotlex]
	* Updated mob AI so that aggressive mobs will change targets if they are
	  attacked and their current target isn't attacking them (regardless of
	  range) [Skotlex]
	* Some updates to the pet AI so their chase range is range3 instead of the
	  hardcoded value of 13. [Skotlex]
	* Reverted Mika's fix since it makes it impossible for mobs to heal each
	  other. (what is the so called exp bug about?) [Skotlex]
	* Fixed a possible crash in clif_equiplist(), thanks to Zoc [Skotlex]
	* Spells are now considered a "miss" if they do no damage (this prevents
	  additional effects from triggering out such as freezing) [Skotlex]
	* Temp bug fix of Exp increase when healing non-undead mob (by MiKa) [Lupus]
2005/10/17
	* Updated sql-files/mob_db.sql to match with the current one. [Skotlex]
	  (someone else also did this, but missed a few values from Incantation
	  Samurai. Altough who did it and why it is failed to be mentioned in the
	  log files?) [Skotlex]
	* Fixed alchemists not being able to hit their marine spheres (how many
	  times this same bug keeps coming back from the dead anyway?) [Skotlex]
	* Updated sql-files/item_db.sql to the current item_db.txt [Skotlex]
	*  Fixed magic rod not cancelling the additional effects from skills. [Skotlex]
	* Cleaned up the card inserting code to prevent crashes from modified
	  packets. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed offensive heal [Skotlex]
	* Applied a random chance when reducing the mob's chase duration. This
	  should randomize how long the mob chases you around before giving up.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Some modifications to the timer push heap function, may fix timer issues
	  when creating timers with tick values that overflow. [Skotlex]
	* Modified the mob ai so it has a seek time, when the min_chase runs out
	  (it is constantly decreased while chasing, starts out at range3) the mob
	  will stop chasing, do a /swt, and stop being aggro for 10 secs. This is how
	  it should be according to what I understood from Komurka's explanation.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Added config monster_ai, it determines some of the mob behaviour:
	- If &1, mobs will use hard path finding to reach their target, otherwise
	  only easy (straight line) path searches will be used (for most offensive
	  purposes).
	- If &2, mobs will use the rude attacked skill if they can't attack back no
	  matter what, otherwise they use it only if they can't reach the target.
	  [Skotlex]
	- Still pending on what other things it could define. Currently defaults to
	  0 (seems to be the official mob ai) [Skotlex]
	* Now Atk/Matk potions duration don't get automatically multiplied by 1000,
	  duration must be specified in ms in the scripts. [Skotlex]
	* Made all mobs with no guild belong to the same guild, this should prevent
	  mobs from attacking each other on WoE. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed Into the Abyss + retrieving traps related exploits. [Skotlex]
	* Changed monster_skill_nofootset to no to enable mobs casting stuff like
	  Bomb underneath characters. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed Sacrifice, it can now be recasted on a player as long as it's by
	  the same crusader that is currently protecting the player. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed some unitialized values error in magic and misc attacks. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed  30% bonus from upper/baby classes affecting card bonuses. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed baseClass not working on Acolyte class, thanks to Silent. [Skotlex]
	* Made the stone curse animation only show up on successfully cursing. [Skotlex]
	* Added Meditation's bonus to offensive heal, thanks to Orn. [Skotlex]
	* Made devotion fail when already used on a char with that effect. [Skotlex]
	* Made it so you can't quit while cloaking/hiding, and said status will end
	  on quit if force-quitting. [Skotlex]
	* Cleaned up and fixed isequipped script commands, it should be working
	  correctly now (tested with the Assassin combo) [Skotlex]
	* Fixed not stacking Long Attack Rate bonuses [Lupus]
	- Bow Thimble +3%, Archer Skeleton Card +10%, Merman Card(when CARDS COMBO) +20%
	- We should get rid of that +-15% ranged damage varianc (it doesn't cure "stoprate bug" anyways)
2005/10/16
	* Fixed wrong calculation of items max drop chance (when using MySQL MOB DB) [Lupus]
	* Added nomemo mapflag to more levels of Thanatos Tower, thx2Justin84 [Lupus]
2005/10/14
	* Updated the gvg_dungeon mapflag to mean "guild versus guild regardless of
	  woe schedule" and set it on the guild versus guild maps. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed perfect hiding. [Skotlex]
	* Cleaned up (or rewrote?) the Run and High Jump code to merge them better
	  with the normal walking routines. [Skotlex]
	* Corrected Turn Undead from ignoring element. [Skotlex]
	* Updated Power Thrust Max & Power Thrust so that they don't stack (and
	  only PT Max cancels PT) [Skotlex]
	* Some fine tuning in battle_check_attackable. [Skotlex]
	* Changed db_final's implementation to End of Exam's. [Skotlex]
	* Corrected Guardian removal routines to also update/save their respective
	  Castle data (Guardian HP and visibility) [Skotlex]
	* Added map server setting "enable_spy", must be set to yes/on for @spy
	  commands to work. [Skotlex]
	* Applied End of Exam's fix to the previous fix to the db. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed spyguild/spyparty sending packets to the spied guild/party instead
	  of your own. [Skotlex]
	* Rewrote the card hash implementation. Now it should work correctly for
	  any card set on any equipped item. Supports up to 4 slots in any of the
	  equipped items. [Skotlex]
	* Updated the mob ai so it stops chasing right away if you
	  hide/cloak/vanish/etc. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed some memory issues in the db handling. Credits to End of Exam.
	  [Skotlex]
2005/10/13
	* Updated the main.sql file with some of the recommendations by Zoc
	  [Skotlex]
	- If your sc_data table works as it is, you don't have to touch it.
	* Fixed Maxmize Power/Cloaking sending the sever to an "infinite loop" when
	  used by mobs. [Skotlex]
	* Some cleaning to clif_send in regards to guild-related packets. [Skotlex]
	* Added mob skill condition "afterskill", works like "skillused" except
	  it's triggered after the mob was the one doing the mentioned skill.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Small cleanup and optimization of data saved when received member
	  information. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed some memory issues in script loading and the plugin loading
	  mechanism. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed magic attacks always doing minimum damage. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed the crash in battle_check_attackable [Skotlex]
	* Fixed Fireball hitting twice on the targetted mob. [Skotlex]
	* Updated Recall Guild to work in gvg maps even if the nowarp flag is set.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Updated Recall Partner to warp partner after 20 secs the thing is on the
	  ground, skill is blocked from reusage during that time. [Skotlex]
	* Some updates to correctly decide whether skills hit cloaking and/or
	  hidden chars. [Skotlex]
	* Updated skill code so that heaven's drive will hit and destroy traps
	  (untested), also AoE skills will not trigger on hidden characters. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed the crash on magic rod. [Skotlex]
	* Updated Maximize Power and Cloaking to last forever (until reuse, I
	  believe) for non-players. [Skotlex]
	* Made Berserk end when you logout. [Skotlex]
	* Made song/dances end when you unequip your weapon rather than on equip.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Fixed one bug in battle_calc_magic attack and some cleaning of it as
	  well. [Skotlex]
	* Updated sql-files/mob_db.sql to match the latest mob_db.txt [Skotlex]
	* Updated sql-files/item_db.sql to match the latest item_db.txt. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed stealing. Now it works like aegis one. [Lupus]
2005/10/12
	* Fixed everyone gaining high speed after casting a ground-based skill.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Corrected the magical part of Soul Breaker ignoring mdef. [Skotlex]
	* Updated Reverse Orcish to use the duration specified for the skill in
	  skill_cast_db.txt [Skotlex]
	* Modified REVERSEORCISH to make it a status change (SC_ORCISH), since
	  there's no data about duration, defense, or if any stat reduces it's
	  duration, it currently is fixed to 5 minutes. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed crash when sending the insert card packet with an invalid index. [Skotlex]
	* Added script constant baseClass. [Skotlex]
	- Example: if (baseClass == Job_Novice) will match on all novices and super
	  novices. if (baseClass == Job_Swordman) will match on all Swordmen, Knights
	  and Crusaders. Once tested several item scripts can be simplified in the
	  item_db.
	- In contrast, the already defined baseJob works by stripping the upper
	  kind only. (eg: baseJob == Job_Swordman matches on swordman classes, but
	  not Crusader/Knight)
	- I know the names can be confusing, but anyone has a better suggestion for
	  a name?
	* Added a fix to prevent people from buying equipment in stackable from by
	  hexing the packets and specifying an amount greater than 1. [Skotlex]
	- Thanks to End of Exam for pointing out the exploit.
	* Added flag "move delay" to skill_castnodex_db.txt [Skotlex]
	- By setting this flag to 1, players won't be able to move during the skill
	  delay time. Some reorganization was needed in skill.c to make room for
	  this, so some testing is required.
	* Fixed the Char SQL server unnecessarily loading AND saving parties each
	  time a party-member changed maps. [Skotlex]
	* Modified skill_min_damage so that it defines the minimum damage for
	  skills IF the skill does not misses/is blocked. Can be used to specify
	  to any of weapon attacks, magic attacks, or misc attacks. Defaults to 6
	  (magic + misc attacks) as that is what was set up previously. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed Wand of Hermod and a potential crash related to ground based
	  skills. [Skotlex]
	* Probably corrected npc load count when using reloadscript. [Skotlex]
	* Likely fixed petheal [Skotlex]
	* Fixed PVP client crash bug. By a new cadidate into eA coders LuzZza [Lupus]
	* Updated maps comments, thanks to Justin84 [Lupus]
2005/10/11
	* Fixed not being able to cast resurrection on dead players. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed party HP update crash. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed players being killed always in one hit. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed chars not being able to unhide. [Skotlex]
	* Rewrote/optimized the hp updating code (both party hp and disp_hpmeter),
	  this should lower bandwidth a bit from all the unnecessary packets that
	  were previously being sent. [Skotlex]
	* Removed the mysterious 2.2% drop chance for all items when read from the
	  sql db. [Skotlex]
	* Updated targeted skills and normal attacking to fail when targetting
	  hidden characters. [Skotlex]
	* Merged reddozen and Draco's code regarding TK skills. [Skotlex]
	* Added a function to allow guilds to delete alliances with nonexisting
	  guilds. [Skotlex]
	* Corrected the weapon damage return in battle_weapon_attack, thanks to PeF
	  for pointing it out. [Skotlex]
	* Added max_baby_parameter to define the max parameter for baby classes.
	  Also fixed some instances where the baby parameter restriction was not
	  being taken into account. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed Firewall doing knockback on the undead. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed Waterball count when casted by non-players, thanks to Orn [Skotlex]
	* Fixed the instrument/whips gender restriction being applied to Cap. [Skotlex]
	* Damn typo: Fixed Mobs Drops with the same % droprate. thanx 2rover 4bugreport [Lupus]
	* Fixed SQL Mob DB reading(no drops issue, etc) thanx to yoanykim for pointing it out [Lupus]
2005/10/10
	* Probably fixed the peco-riding issue. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed clif_clearchar_delay (cause of the ghost mobs from my tests). [Skotlex]
	* Small fix on the mob ai (attacked_id was never being reset if the
	  attacker no longer exists). [Skotlex]
	* Added a couple of checks to prevent the mob_ai from executing if the mob
	  is dead. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed a typo in skill_attack which causes all sort of unpredictable
	  behaviour, such as firewall never hitting. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed a memory leak involving pets and cast cancel. [Skotlex]
	* Made Wand of Hermod end when the caster is moved for whatever reason. [Skotlex]
	* Increased the random damage delay modifier to +/-15% [Skotlex]
	* Fixed "rare drop filter" considering "available in shops only items" as RARE items [Lupus]
	* The GM can drop level now also determines whether a GM can store items in
	  the Guild Storage or not. Thanks to Kayla for pointing it out :P [Skotlex]
	* Fixed Grimtooth so that it's slowdown works on both players and mobs.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Fixed Fireball's damage. [Skotlex]
	* Now the Wedding Dress and Tuxedo will always check for the correct
	  gender. [Skotlex]
	* Cleaned up the code for Potion Pitcher. [Skotlex]
	* Reverted Falcon Assault to be 5x Blitz Beat's damage at level 5. [Skotlex]
	* The npc_counter is now reset in a @reloadscript. [Skotlex]
	* Cleaned up Falcon Assault and made it's %dmg increase be an addition on
	  top of Blitz Beat (altough I am not so sure that's right) [Skotlex]
	* Hardcoded the gender restrictions for items with view 13 & 14 (Musical
	  Instruments and Whips), changed ignore_item_genders to yes as default. [Skotlex]
	* Changed GX duration to 900ms. [Skotlex]
	* Cleared up the item get times descriptions in battle_athena.conf [Skotlex]
	* Some timer fixes in status_change_start regarding sc_data loading. [Skotlex]
2005/10/09
	* Probably fixed Waterball so it does max number of hits when casted by a
	  non-player regardless of water availability. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed perfect hiding. [Skotlex]
	* Corrected magic damage return to only work on targetted skills [Skotlex]
	* Some cleaning up of the skill_attack function. [Skotlex]
	* At last finished 2 last logs filters options: [Lupus]
		- Implemented 'Rare' items option (you can set rare_items_log value)
		- Implemented 'Big amount' of items option (it would always log big set amount of items (per 1 action!) despite on the other filter option)
	* Updated @iteminfo ATcommand. It would show you additional item info. [Lupus]
		- Monsters drop this item with ?.?% chance
		- Monsters don't drop this item
		- This item is available in the shops only
	- Tip: When you Trade/Vend goods, use @iteminfo to check items price and even rareness ^_-
	* Rearranged item_data struct units to make it compatible with some old script commands after Skotlex's changes
	- Tip: Now you can use GetItemInfo script command to find out if the item is rare or not
2005/10/08
	* Some improvements to the mob ai. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed summoned marine spheres exploding on their own. [Skotlex]
	* Probably fixed the attribute fix for magical attacks. [Skotlex]
	* Made the gender check to not be ignored by default [Skotlex]
	- This is necessary because the new job ID system makes both Dancer and
	  Bard be treated as the same job, so all bard/dancer comparisons were
	  changed to be gender comparisons, thus, the gender check is indispensable
	  for their weapons.
	* Updated item_db structure. new column upper (after equip_jobs) defines
	  the type of job that can equip the item (1: Normal jobs, 2: Upper jobs,
	  4: Baby jobs), merged the use_script and equip_script columns into one.
	  Also the equip_jobs column now has support for the following classes:
	  Taekwon (2^24), Star Gladiator (2^25) and Soul Linker (2^26)
	  The provided db/item_db.txt and sql-files/item_db,sql are already updated
	  with all the necessary changes (all equipable/usable items have their
	  upper set to 7)..
	- Lupus, Nexus, get working on updating the item_db.
	* Made FrostJoke/Scream work the same way out and inside woe grounds.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Corrected Grand Cross Damage [Skotlex]
2005/10/07
	* Took out Lighthalzen's noteleport mapflag. Added it by accident. [Nexon]
	* Some commented code cleanup and help.txt update [Foruken]
	* Applied Draco's fixes to battle_calc_magic_attack. [Skotlex]
	* Modified @showexp and @showdelay so they will work as people would expect
	  them to. [Skotlex]
	* Figured out what ## variables are, and documented it on
	  doc/script_commands.txt [Skotlex]
	* Foruken pointed out that the actual script problem was a certain
	  acalloc() that was changed to realloc(), so undid the last revert and
	  reverted this one instead.  [Skotlex]
	* Fixed a char-sql issue where character variables seemed to be saving
	  incorrectly. [Skotlex]
	* Removed a free() that was added on R3421 that was supposed to fix a
	  memory leak but instead causes crashes :/ (so the memory leak is back in
	  there, but no more crash) [Skotlex] 
	* Applied End of Exam's script engine patch. [Skotlex]
	- This adds support for nested blocks, if/else, fors, switches. See
	  <http://eathena.deltaanime.net/board/index.php?showtopic=50037>
	  for more information. Note that he admits it is not fully tested, so be
	  careful when trying out the new commands!
2005/10/06
	* Some corrections to the script engine, should fix a few memory leaks.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Minor corrections to the screen output of the char_sql server when
	  saving. [Skotlex]
	* Corrected authorisation issues in msg_athena.conf [Skotlex]
	* Updated Wand of Hermod [Skotlex]
	- Can't amp out of it.
	- Affects everyone
	- Only prevents people from casting supportive skills.
	* Fixed mobs not doing their "rude-attacked" skill. [Skotlex]
	* Corrected casters being able to walk during Wand of Hermod [Skotlex]
	* Made Guild Recall be usable outside of WoE. [Skotlex]
	* Changed the default gvg_traps_target_all to yes. [Skotlex]
	* Changed the default for copyskill_restrict to 2 (cannot copy advanced
	  skills) [Skotlex]
	* Added a bunch of code related to the 2nd job quest skills and Tae -second
	  classes skills, as provided by Draco and acquired from jA [Skotlex]
	* Merged Draco's implementation of battle_calc_magic_attack. [Skotlex]
	* Modifications to the mob AI to more accurately use Range2 (mob's sight
	  range) and Range3 (mob's chase distance ability) [Skotlex]
	* Cleaned up item_db.txt, updated sql-files/item_db.sql to match. [Skotlex]
	* Added logarithmic drops support for TXT itemdb loading (how could I had
	  forgotten that?) [Skotlex]
	* Added battle options item_rate_treasure, item_drop_treasure_min,
	  item_drop_treasure_max, these override all other rate options when it comes
	  to Treasure box drops. [Skotlex]
	* Cleaned up battle_athena.conf regarding drop rates. mvp_item_rate has
	  been changed to item_rate_mvp. [Skotlex]
	* Implemented Maya Purple card effect (you can see any hidden mob). Thanks to jA [Lupus]
	* Updated functions: pc_calc_base_job,pc_calc_base_job2 [Lupus]
	- They return 24:Taekwon, 25:StarGladiator, 27:Soul Linker
	  Now someone should UPDATE Job fields of item_db.txt for TK,SL,SG classes
	  then I'll remove ugly hardcoded "temp plug" from pc_isequip function
	  [Item_DB JOB field note]: We don't check Knight2,Crusader2,Star Gladiator2 bits,
		so don't set them.
	  In other words we use only these bits:
		0-Novice,1-Swordman,2,3,4,5,6-Thief
		7-Knight,8,9,10,11,12-Assassin,14-Crusader,15,16,17,18,19,20-Dancer
		23-Super Novice
		24-TK,25-SG,27-SL
	  Don't ever use other bits e.g. for Advanced classes. It's useless
	* Added Poring Box logs (into dead branch logs)
2005/10/05
	* Updated nomemo and noteleports for Lighthalzen/Einbroch/Einbech maps and others. [Nexon]
	* Fixed the mob AI. [Skotlex]
	* Updated alchemist_summon_reward [Skotlex]
	- Summons now never give exp, and they may drop items according to setting:
	  0: Never drop items
	  1: Only Marine spheres drop items (default)
	  2: All summons drop items.
	  (maybe a different battle option can be made to make summons give exp?)
	* Simplified the Grand Cross code. [Skotlex]
	  It is now entirely a magical attack with extra damage of the form base
	  atk * skill%  - armor def% - vit def. Note that weapon properties won't
	  apply now as well as many of the offensive cards (those that do not apply
	  to both magic and weapon attacks, that is), and the def penalty from
	  having many mobs targeted on one is not applying neither (so the full
	  def is being taken into consideration). Report any corrections further
	  needed.
	* Cleaned up, organized and improved somewhat the mob ai code. [Skotlex]
	  (update and test at your own risk as I can't test it currently)
	* Some corrections to the way the guild master's name is updated during a
	  gm change. [Skotlex]
	* Added a check to avoid saving negative durations for status changes. [Skotlex]
	* Added a check to avoid loading status changes with negative durations
	  (the walk freeze problems seem related to timers and sc_data loading, so I
	  am shooting in the dark here at possible problem sources) [Skotlex]
	* Various cleanups to ensemble related code, Longing For Freedom may be
	  working now. [Skotlex]
	* Added the water levels to ayo_dun01, gon_dun01 and lhz_dun03, thanks to
	  Master of Muppets [Skotlex]
	* Made Autocounter trigger autospells (was not doing so because it's NK
	  defines it as a no-damage skill) [Skotlex]
	* Some cleanups on the mob slave AI code. [Skotlex]
	* Added battle config retaliate_to_master, defaults to yes. [Skotlex]
	- Why? Because in official, summoned mobs are not attacked by other mobs
	  (speaking about alchemists), if you set this to no, then mobs will
	  retaliate against the summon (both @summon and alchemist ones).
	* Some fixes to the way the guildmaster flag is being set and checked. [Skotlex]
	* Made the skilllv be 1 if the client sends less than that (this is why
	  active guild skills were not working. For some reason the client was
	  sending a request to do the skill at level 0!) [Skotlex]
2005/10/04
	* Likely fixed Aeterna + Soul Breaker/Destroyer. [Skotlex]
	* Some cleaning of the mob ai. May help with some of the current exploits.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Corrected Mob_ai code to make supportive mobs properly gang up on
	  summons. [Skotlex]
	* Moved the plagiarize code to execute it before dealing damage (because on
	  WoE you are auto-restored when you get killed, hence the player was 'alive'
	  and it would copy the skill when killed by it on WoE) [Skotlex]
	* Fixed Classical Pluck blocking AoE spells. [Skotlex]
	* Updated Spider Web code to not retrigger if already trapped by one
	  (needed because spider webs can now stack) [Skotlex]
2005/10/03
	* Fixed a mistake with my last fix. [Kevin]
	* Fixed often occurring memory leak in clif.c. [Kevin]
	* Made NPC_DARKCROSS work (it's just a copy of Holy Cross with dark
	  attribute) [Skotlex]
	* Removed resetting the manner when a player is saved. [Skotlex]
	* Cleaned up map reading code to make it remove maps that could not be
	  loaded. It prevents crashes related to maps that weren't correctly loaded
	  on startup. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed Endure to make it add armor mdef. [Skotlex]
	* Small fixes to updating the guild master's name during a guild master
	  change. [Skotlex]
	* Some corrections to the mob ai to enable mobs to attack other mobs
	  (summoned ones, of course) [Skotlex]
	* Updated autotrading so that the char will close the shop and quit the map
	  server automatically when there's nothing left to vend. [Skotlex]
	* Added checks to prevent a char from joining/creating multiple chat rooms
	  (anti-crash fix, it is). [Skotlex]
	* Cleaned up and restructured the mob item drop code. It also fixes a
	  possible crash during the autoloot check. [Skotlex]
	* Reupdated Wind Walk to add +5% flee bonus... AGAIN. [Skotlex]
2005/10/02
	* Fixed STEAL issue. [Lupus]
	- Any Mob has 10 drop slots. If we pick an empty one, then we check previous slot, until we find a slot with an item.
	  Then we apply STEAL FORMULA for the item. (During the tests I managed to steal 2 poring cards 8)
	  If a mod doesn't have any slots then STEAL fails.
	- Possible exploit: If a mob (e.g. NEW MOBS) has only one rare drop, then STEAL would always try to steal that the only slot 8)
	  How to fix: I suggest to fill other empty slots with Jellopies or Apples with zero chance.
2005/10/01
	* Expanded NPC shop log info of sold items (cards, refine, etc) [Lupus]
	* Fixed compile errors in converters [celest]
	* Updating built-in zlib to 1.2.3 [celest]
	* Added unzip functions to grfio.c [celest]
	* Finished Fusion AF2 maps support - just put the .af2 files in the
	  afm folder and start the map server as usual [celest]
	  NOTE: It will need a new unzip library, so do 'make clean', or delete
	  'Makefile.cache' before recompiling!

2005/09/30
	* Updated the slave warp code. Now when a master recalls their slaves,
	  these will be placed 'randomly' around the master in an area_size/2 range.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Cleaned up the mob link (supportive mode) code to prevent wasting time
	  trying to link friends every 100ms. Now the interval for linking friends is
	  MOB_MINLINKTIME (1 sec currently) [Skotlex]
	* Updated mob code so when a mob hits another, they set their 'attacked id'
	  to the mob in question, and not the mob's master. [Skotlex]
	* Some cleaning up of the Taekwon stance skills. Added a attack delay when
	  they trigger (same way as triple attack delays your continous attack) [Skotlex]
	* Modified the range check in skill_use_id/skill_use_pos so that if you try
	  to use a skill while moving, it will change your path to move one cell towards the
	  target before casting (as long as you are within one tile of being in
	  range). [Skotlex]
	* Moved the bleeding reduction formula to status_change_start, modified the
	  formula to be (lv/5+vit)% reduction. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed the blind duration reduction formula. [Skotlex]
	* Upgraded Meteor Assault so you can specify the duration of
	  blind/stun/bleeding independently in skill_cast_db.txt [Skotlex]
	* Made TK_JUMPKICK share the same code as Ashura Strike (just to see what
	  happens, both seem like they behave the same way, no?) [Skotlex]
2005/09/29
	* Some tweaks and fixes around status.c, may fix the timer mismatches of
	  status_change_timer. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed a memory leak regarding pet status recovery scripts. [Skotlex]
	* Added timestamp support. Set timestamp_format to whatever you want, and
	  it will print a timestamp in said format before every Show* message. They
	  can be set independently for each server (defined at login_athena.conf,
	  char_athena.conf and map_athena.conf). Default is using no timestamps. [Skotlex]
	* Modified the new auth login system to take into consideration when the
	  client tries to connect before the character data arrives from the char
	  server. [Skotlex]
	  (seems to work well, but could use more testing)
	* Corrected the description of the 'skill_add_range' switches and made them
	  default to 5. Still pending further tuning (the official value of these
	  switches should have is still unknown) [Skotlex]
	* Added Demonstration to list of skills affected by
	  'gvg_traps_target_all' [Skotlex]
	* Likely fixed Firepillar triggering multiple times when many characters
	  step unto it. [Skotlex]
	* Increased the damage delay randomizer to be +/-10% rather than +/-5%, may
	  fix 'stun-lock'. [Skotlex]
	* Added Consumable items log into pick_log [Lupus]
	- You can see logs when someone uses items (boxes, potions, etc)
	* Added AtCommands/CharCommands items deletion/creation log into pick_log [Lupus]
	* Removed some of the unnecessary verbose messages from the char server
	  during data saving. [Skotlex]
	* Added the new "online check" system (more of a fixing of a system that
	  was already there but was half working) [Skotlex]
	  it is turned on/off by using the online_check config options for the
	  login and char servers.
	- char server: When the check is on, players are kicked out of the char
	  server when their character is already online, and the map servers are
	  instructed to kick the account out as well. If there's no reply from the
	  map servers, the char is automatically set offline after 15 secs.
	- login server: When the check is on, players get "rejected from server"
	  when the account is online already, and afterwards the char servers are
	  told to kick that account out (like in the first case), if after 30 secs
	  there is no reply from the char servers logging off the account, the login
	  server sets it offline on it's  own.
	- The checks are by default on as they are meant to prevent possible
	  exploits on multi-map servers.
	- However, I have not figured out where exactly a char server gets to know
	  that a player has changed map-servers, so this could cause trouble in said
	  enviroments until I figure it out (it won't go out of sync forever since
	  the map servers do update their list of online characters every then
	  seconds) :/
	* Fixed crash, related to STEAL logs [Lupus]
	* Added TXT logs for Pick_log [Lupus]
2005/09/28
	* Added 'scripts items operations' and 'vending' into pick_log: [Lupus]
	  Tested with refine, getitem, getnameditem, removecards, etc commands. They are all supported.
	  Now you can see if a player breaks his armor in NPC Cards Remover, etc.
	  You can track down any item within a single DB.
	  You can make a SQL query to find which items are most popular, which quests are most popular, etc
	  Of course, it could help you to find your local items exploits, cheaters and unfail admins ^_-
	- Added 'Autolooted' and 'Stolen' items into pick_log
	- TODO: Add TXT logs
	* Fixed JobMaster NPC. Thanks Amada [Kayla]
	* Removed card-fix flag from Cart Termination. [Skotlex]
	* Updated battle_check_target so that a mob will consither another mob an
	  enemy if either one has special mob ai (is a @summon or summoned alchemist
	  mob). Summons from the same master should not be attacking each other,
	  however I do think they will attack summons from another player. [Skotlex]
	* Removed 10 chances to pick an item from STEAL skill (it should have only 1 chance) [Lupus]
2005/09/27
	* Corrected again Wind Walk. Just +5 flee at lv10, walk bonus does not
	  stacks with other speed giving skills. [Skotlex]
	* Corrected Wind Walk's walk and flee bonus (walk was a +4*skill_lv%
	  increase! and flee was +5 flee, rather than +5% flee of your total).
	  [Skotlex]
	* Added atcommand @changeleader, transfers the leadership of a party to
	  someone else. [Skotlex]
	  (defaults as a GM-level 10 command, not quite yet tested)
	* Added delitem2 script command with script sample by Mihilion [Lupus]
	* Removed the check that prevented chars from logging out during status
	  changes, as the current system should save and restore these correctly.
	  [Skotlex]
2005/09/26
	* Fixed MAX GUILD capasity in mmo.h to allow correct +6 Guild Extension [Lupus]
	* Changed back the TIMER_MIN_INTERVAL to 50. Who changed it back to 25?
	  (svn3015 skotlex: Changed TIMER_MIN_INTERVAL to 25 (from 10), it probably needs to be bumped even higher, awaiting results from testers to see if a higher value would be needed.
	   svn1284 lupus: timers optimization / speed up / bug fix : no freezing mobs [TIMER_MIN_INTERVAL: 50->10])
	  (note to self: make this a setting in inter_athena.conf) [Skotlex]
	* Guild Extension now adds 6 per level. [Skotlex]
	* Added define ENABLE_SC_SAVING in common/mmo.h, comment/remove this line
	  to disable saving of status changes (temporary measure) [Skotlex]
	* Updated Double Casting to only work on Firebolt, Coldbolt and
	  Thunderbolt. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed cloaking/hiding. [Skotlex]
	* Updates to status_change_start, scdata loading now should display on the
	  targetted player. [Skotlex]
	* Removed card modifiers from Meteor Assault. [Skotlex]
	* Corrected skill_out_range_consume so that spells effectively fail if the
	  target goes out of range. [Skotlex]
	* Another another check on the new auth system which may help prevent
	  exploits. [Skotlex]
	* General cleanup and code improvements needed because of the new auth
	  system. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed a bug in the new auth system (TXT) which was causing the gender to
	  be pretty much randomly sent. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed a bug in changesex at the TXT char server level. [Skotlex]
	* Updated new logging system. Now logs TRADE, NPC Shops [Lupus]
	* Fixed a possible exploit in the new auth system. Thanks to End of Exam
	  for the information. [Skotlex]
	* Corrected True Sight critical bonus. [Skotlex]
	* Water Ball will now do the full number of hits regardless of available
	  water when used by non-players. [Skotlex]
	* Changed the emoticon delay to 1 second. [Skotlex]
	* Zeny/item kill bonuses now work on all skills, and not just physical
	  weapon attacks. [Skotlex]
	* Added official Ayothaya Town script by MasterOfMuppets [Lupus]
	* Added new Players / Monster Drops / Pickups Logging system [Lupus]
	- Changed new log table, now it has field 'type':
		M = Monsters Drop, P = Players Drop/Take, L = Mobs Loot Drop/Take, T = Players Trade Give/Take,
		V = Players Vending Sell/Take, S = Shop Sell/Take, N = NPC Give/Take
		NOTE: 'looted drop' might has cards, refine, etc. 'common drop' has item w/o cards/refine
	- Now you can see Players(cheaters) passing any items w/o trade
	- Now MOBS+PLAYERS drops come in the same table (easy to query)
		Poring -5 Apple
		Zelgadis +5 Apple
	- You can tell off monsters by their LOW id.  < 2000~ 
	- Negative value of AMOUNT shows that a mob, or a player has dropped that items amount
	- Positive value of AMOUNT shows that a player has pickedup that items amount
	- It works 5x faster than old DROPLOGS
	- TXT logs don't work yet
	- TODO: Add Autolooted & MVP items in the log, too.
	- TODO: Add Mobs Looters DROP items in the log. (Now only attacked mobs log loot drops)
	- TODO: Add Scripts/Vending logs

2005/09/25
	* Modified battle_weapon_delay so that additional status effects are
	  invoked even if the attack does no damage, as long as the attack connects
	  (that is, it is not a miss/lucky dodge) [Skotlex]
2005/09/24
	* Updated several mob stats for the Lighthalzen and later mobs from the
	  data provided by Viccious Pucca. [Skotlex]
	* Updated sql-files/mob_db.sql to contain the most recent mob_db. [Skotlex]
	* Added support for saving/loading status changes when characters log
	  in/out. [Skotlex]
	- TXT users: the file used by default is scdata.txt, can be changed by
	  setting scdata_txt to something else in inter_athena.txt.
	- SQL users the table used by default is sc_data, can be changed by setting
	  scdata_db to something else in inter_athena.txt. Use upgrade_svn3273.sql to
	  generate the new table.
	- It is currently unknown the behaviour of restoring some status changes,
	  if any anomality shows up, do report.
	- Currently, even thought the sc data is restored, the client does not
	  receives the packet telling them that the effect started (like Gloria, you
	  can see you have +30 luk, but the message is never there) nor the visual
	  effects are in neither. This is a side effect of starting the status
	  effects on a player before the client finished loading the maps and spawns
	  in the map. Will be fixed later.
	* Some memory optimizations tothe new auth system. [Skotlex]
	* Moved the charsave_method config to inter_athena.txt [Skotlex]
	* Fixed Demonstration/Bomb getting 100% breaking chance on low skill break
	  rates [Skotlex]
	* Fixed chars being able to cast skills while rooted if they didn't have at
	  least root lv1 [Skotlex]
	* Removed Assert in pet_walk, use a less unstable debugging tool, causes
	  errors in remote shells. [Kevin]
	* Fixed TXT char login with new auth system. [Kevin]
	* Done: Adjustable players titles for @who, @who2, @who3 commands [Lupus]
	- Check msg_athena.conf for new lines
2005/09/23
	* Software Caused Connection Abort errors will now cause said socket to be
	  removed inmediately from the listening list of sockets, this may help with
	  the lag issues that arise when said error occurs. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed Demonstration having 100% breaking chance if you set skill breaking
	  chance to 0. [Skotlex]
	* Swapped functions of @who and @who3 commands. Because it's a spoil [Lupus]
	  to show players locations. You may enable @who for your common players now.
	  there's a shortcut for @WHO: @W
	* Started adding adjustable players titles for @who, etc commands [Lupus]
	- e.g. Super Player, GM, GM+, etc
2005/09/22
	* Updated sql-files/item_db.sql to have the most current version. [Skotlex]
	* Finished first part of new auth system, fully tested. Will reduce char->map
	  lag by whatever it is you are haveing. [Kevin]
	* Added consideration of GrandDarkness in various code sections that were
	  only checking for Grand Cross [Skotlex]
	* Deployed use of map_getallusers all over the map server where it makes
	  sense to include disconnected players. [Skotlex]
	* Corrected map_getallusers to depend on the actual count of players in the
	  db rather than the variable users (prevents possible crashes if the two
	  differ) [Skotlex]
	* Updated the player counting function so that it correctly accounts for
	  all players (including those not connected like in autotrade) [Skotlex]
	* Characters will now automatically stand if Soul Drain is triggered while
	  sitting. [Skotlex]
	* Set default option gvg_traps_target_all: no [Lupus]
	- In kRO it used to be 'yes' some time ago but has been reverted back to 'no'
2005/09/21
	* Corrected an error in the way guild alliances were being counted, as
	  pointed out by Viccious Pucca. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed and deployed map_getallusers() on atcommands @who, @who2, @who3.
	  [Skotlex]
	- This function should enable the aforementioned commands to work even on
	  players who are in the server but are not connected (eg: autotrade
	  players). It is temporarily only deployed on the @who functions pending on
	  feedback (bug reports, anything) before going ahead and implementing it on
	  all relevant atcommand/charcommand/script functions.
	* Replaced the trim() function with Furoken's implementation (it should
	  remove tabs, consecutive spaces and other such unwanted characters from a
	  char's name) [Skotlex]
	* Updated doc/script_commands.txt to explain the upper parameter of the
	  function jobchange. [Skotlex]
	* Corrected sql query errors when logging trades and vending. [Skotlex]
	* Updated doc/script_commands.txt with the script commands I've modified
	  or added that are not yet described within. [Skotlex]
	* Small fix to clif.c which corrects characters that can't log in again if
	  they log out when the char and map server are not connected. [Skotlex]
	* Cleaned up all SQL error reporting. It now follows the same standard
	  everywhere, and is followed by a debug line which includes the file, line
	  number and contents of the attempted query which caused the error. [Skotlex]
	* Corrected an sql logs error when selecting a character with special
	  characters (eg: single quotes) on it. [Skotlex]
2005/09/20
	* Changed Palm Strike's initial animation display. [Skotlex]
	  (it will show as a normal attack that misses instead of an skill, but at
	  least the animation delay is correct and the skill can be chained now)
	* Adjusted Cart Revolution's damage to be based on the Cart's Max Weight
	  (instead of the hardcoded 8000w value) [Skotlex]
	* Fixed a memory leak when pets cancel their casting. [Skotlex]
2005/09/19
	* Added error reporting an item in the item_db.txt file has insufficient
	  fields (rather than just crashing) [Skotlex]
	* Updated the item_db to use the new race and element constants. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed (I think) battle option muting_players. Defaulted it to yes. [Skotlex]
	* Added timers for displaying guildmates position. [Skotlex]
	- All the packet related code was already there by Valaris, so I wonder why
	  this wasn't finished before?
	* Added battle_athena options max_def/over_def_bonus (read
	  battle_athena.conf for desc) [Skotlex]
	* Added error reporting when the magreg file fails to be saved. [Skotlex]
	* Made berserk castable during the no-regen period when it expires. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed a query error on sql refine logging. [Skotlex]
	* General checks to the script engine string management. Should fix a bunch
	  of memory leaks. [Skotlex]
2005/09/18
	* More updates to status change IDs [DracoRPG]
	* Implemented TK_SEVENWIND, allowed simultaneous use of several stances, thanks to
	  reddozen for all the info about that [DracoRPG]
	* Allowed to pickup/drop items while in Frenzy [DracoRPG]
2005/09/17
	* Added a check that should prevent fighting against other guilds outside
	  of WoE times. [Skotlex]
	* Hopefully fixed Hunter's Dectect skill. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed the packet issues on the char txt server. [Skotlex]
	* Miscellanous corrections to skill_attack. [Skotlex]
	* Corrected the AutoSpellWhenHit rate of all items in the db (TXT + SQL)
	  [Skotlex]
2005/09/16
	* Reverted some of the contents of skill_unit_move_unit_group since the
	  previous algorithm was optimized. Walking during a Song/Dance should be
	  smooth again. [Skotlex]
	* Rewrote the guild gm changing system. [Skotlex]
	- @changegm works now (tested in SQL, TXT should also be working)
	- Added script command "guildchangegm <guild id>,<new master's name>". Now
	  go write some Guild Master changing npc if you want it to cost money, have
	  a minimum guild level requirement, etc.
	* Added Ishizu's logarithmic drops equation. [Skotlex]
	  (see battle_athena.conf for full details)
	* Added a sub-function call to clear Castle owners when their guild is
	  broken. [Skotlex]
	* Added a char-server call to clear the alliance when a guild is broken
	  (when a guild breaks, the alliance/opposition is removed from memory on the
	  map server, so it seems said change is not sent/saved on the char-server
	  side?) [Skotlex]
	* Added script function sc_start4, starts an status change with all four
	  values. [Skotlex]
	  Use: sc_start4 TYPE, DURATION, VAL1, VAL2, VAL3, VAL4, <target ID>
	* Added SC_ARMOR_ELEMENT/SC_DefEle, specifies elemental defense bonus
	  against two elements at a time. For example:
	  sc_start4 SC_DefEle, 60000, Ele_Fire, 20, Ele_Wind, -15;
	  Gives 20% additional fire resistance and reduces 15% Wind resistance for
	  60 seconds.
	* Expanded battle_attr_fix to consider the status changes of the involved
	  chars that affect elemental modifiers. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed some status effects not being correctly ended/recalculated when you
	  stepped out of quagmire/song/dances. [Skotlex]
	* Made quagmire be affected by the "gvg_traps_target_all" battle switch. [Skotlex]
	* Added Bloody Branch log (along with Dead Branch) [Lupus]
2005/09/15
	* The skill Vending will now fail on GM characters who do not satisfy the
	  gm_can_drop level requirement. [Skotlex]
	* Updated the sql-files mob_db.sql and item_db.sql files to the current
	  version (just feed'em to sql to have your item_db and mob_db tables
	  updated). [Skotlex]
	* Now @allskill and it's ilk will give you ALL skills except the ones
	  marked as "npc skills" (those have an inf2 value of 2). [Skotlex]
	* Some code optimization around song/dances, now the ensemble should be
	  cancelled if you walk (or are knocked out or whatever) out of it.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Added log support to N slots. Now all cards should be logged [Skotlex]
	- Note that I have not been able to test it yet, so report back any
	  problems caused by it.
	* Fixed a memory leak when removing disconnected chars. [Skotlex]
	* Re-enabled the Memory Manager by default. [Skotlex]
	* Updated atcommand @rates so that it displays current exp rates in x form
	  (eg: "Current rates: Base 4.5x, Job 8.0x") as suggested by Mellowz.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Corrected resetskill messing up with Wedding Skills. [Skotlex]
	* Some adjustment to the status change defense (as per data provided by
	  Viccious Pucca) [Skotlex]
	* VVVS weapons now give +50 damage instead of +40 (again thanks to
	  Viccious) [Skotlex]
	* Success rate of making Star Crumbs now is 100% (regardless of skill
	  level?) [Skotlex]
	* Couple of crash fixes on the map-server char saving method
	  (char_save_method: 1) [Skotlex]
2005/09/14
	* Yet another correction to SQL char saving. [Skotlex]
	* Added support for N slots. [Skotlex]
	- By changing the constant MAX_SLOTS in common/mmo.h, the server can be
	  configured to support items with more than 4 slots. Saving/Loading and
	  inserting of cards should be working correctly. Features still missing
	  are including the extra slots in the log functions and updating clif.c to
	  send the extra cards to the client (This is still work in progress).
	- SQL Users interested in using this, need to manually add columns card4,
	  card5 and so on to the relevant tables (cart_inventory, guild_storage,
	  inventory, storage), example query:
	  ALTER TABLE inventory ADD COLUMN card4 int(11) NOT NULL default
	  '0' AFTER card3;
	- TXT users need do nothing, the char server handles the
	  expanding/contracting of slots internally (if the number of slots is
	  shrinked, the additional slotted cards are lost)
	- Never set the amount of slots to less than 4, as they are needed for
	  forged equipment.
	* Likely fixed Lex Divina. [Skotlex]
	* Likely fixed sql char-saving, too. [Skotlex]
	* Lex Divina can now be casted on allies as long as they are silenced.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Fixed crashes on GVG grounds involving characters with no guild. [Skotlex]
	* Added a few socket features from Freya which hopefully will help
	  stabilize eA on Windows (testing needed!) [Skotlex]
	* Miscellanous fixes and rewrites to memitemdata_to_sql, it'll probably
	  fixed the stackable named items duplication exploit. [Skotlex]
	  (note that it is not tested, so there's the chance I broke everything
	  instead, so upgrade for testing purposes only and report back!)
	* Changed HP/SP drain rates so that the max (100%) is 1000. Adjusted item
	  db accordingly. [Skotlex]
	* Disabled chars from muting themselves (as a temporary measure against the
	  mysterious "don't use bot!" message) [Skotlex]
	* Added atcommand logging for /monster and /item (not quite tested yet, but
	  I think it'll work) [Skotlex]
	* Changed autospell rates so that the max (100%) is 1000. Adjusted item
	  database accordingly. [Skotlex]
	* Reverted displayed heal value. [Skotlex]
2005/09/13
	* Fixed Basilica [Skotlex]
	* Rewrote the mechanics of how Devotion works. [Skotlex]
	* Updated Heal so that it displays on-screen the actual amount that was
	  healed. [Skotlex]
	* Changed the damage motion equation to 1/4th of what it was before (now
	  using player_damage_delay_rate: 100 is what was player_damage_delay_rate:
	  25 in previous revisions) [Skotlex]
	* The login servers will now notify when a player has an account ID under
	  700000 (which won't let them connect to the map server) [Skotlex]
	* Added support for SC_BLEEDING in skill_counter_additional_effect &
	  skill_additional_effect [Skotlex]
	* Changed bonuses bAtkRate, bWeaponAtkRate and bCritRate to modify
	  base+watk damage, not just watk. [Skotlex]
	* Corrected coma-effect killing bosses. [Skotlex]
2005/09/12
	* Party even share code won't try to give dead players their share of the
	  exp (since pc_gainexp would refuse so anyway) [Skotlex]
	* Added trim() usage to char servers to prevent creation of characters with
	  spaces at the beginning or end of name. [Skotlex]
	  (the client won't let me create chars with said names so I can't really
	  test it, but on the very least valid names are not crashing it as far as
	  I can see)
	* Expansion/optimization of the skill unit code. Now it should be correctly
	  identified when a character walks into a skill cell, walks out of a skill
	  cell, and walks out of the skill group (performance optimization,
	  client-side: songs and dance effects will work correctly, and Quagmire
	  won't spam "speed up/down" messages). [Skotlex]
	- Got basic testing only (casting, amp/encore, walking, being knocked back,
	  warping), so report any problems found.
	* Bomb/Demonstration should now be cast-able under the Emperium. [Skotlex]
	* Acid Terror now knows ignores armor defense, but not vit defense. [Skotlex]
	* Added an official Bards Job Quest (check npc\changelog.txt) [Lupus]
2005/09/11
	* Changed back the default of gx_all_hit to no. [Skotlex]
	* Added check to prevent ensemble skills from changing position. [Skotlex]
2005/09/10
	* Removed the changing of targets for offensive songs in gvg grounds. [Skotlex]
	* Corrected Grand Cross not always hitting 3 times. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed the display of Auto Counter. [Skotlex]
	* Added check to prevent auto-spells from being casted when the source and
	  target are the same (normally you can't hit yourself, though....) [Skotlex]
	* Fixed Root [Skotlex]
	* Fixed the issue which made mobs do nothing. [Skotlex]
	* Change Provoke to affect armor def of mobs, and vit def of mobs/players. [Skotlex]
	* Another change to autocounter, I think it will work now. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed Defender's aspd bonus. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed rooted character's root level (instead of using the caster's level) [Skotlex]
	* Windows builds will now abort and exit when there's a "Software Caused
	  Connection Abort" error since it seems unrecoverable.. [Skotlex]
	* Reverted back my char.c/sql char.c changes 8) Have to re-check [Lupus]
	* Added official Louyang city (thanks to MasterOfMuppets), fixed some Kafra bugs [Lupus]
	  check npc/changelog.txt
2005/09/09
	* Fixed TXT/SQL char servers not reading properly their command line arguments [Lupus]
	* Refixed those compiler errors >.< [Skotlex]
	* Readded the damage delay to firewall. [Skotlex]
	* Added an extra db (pc_db) to hold players, it should speed up map_id2sd
	  lookups. [Skotlex]
	  (note that all functions which do a search on all connected players do a
	  linear search on the connection sessions, and porting this to use the new
	  system will take a pretty annoyingly long time)
	* Added checks to prevent dropped items from stacking (they can still
	  stack, but at max 2 items per cell). [Skotlex]
	* Added Guild removing from memory upon guild break to Char SQL server
	  (TXT already had this correctly) [Skotlex]
	* Changed Provoke to reduce armor defense, not vit defense. [Skotlex]
	* Likely fixed the direction check in Auto Counter. [Skotlex]
	* Removed the console functionality from socket.c (it was no good on the
	  map server since that session is used on disconnected players), also added
	  more checks to prevent parsing session 0. [Skotlex]
	* Added check to prevent skills from triggering auto-skills of the same id
	  (prevents unlimited chain-reactions) [Skotlex]
	* General fixes to guardian spawning code. [Skotlex]
	  (includes setting a timer so the Emperium gets it's guild data if not
	  available at spawn time).
	* When the Emperium's guild is not found (in mob_spawn_sub, 5 secs after
	  trying to spawn it) the Castle will be reset back to no guild owning. [Skotlex]
	* Fix to battle_check_target, should correct guardians/emperium [Skotlex]
	* Guardians will now be deleted if their guild is not found in
	  mob_spawn_guardian_sub. [Skotlex]
2005/09/08
	* Added filter into chat log. Check log_athena.conf for more info [Lupus]
	- Now you can turn off logs during WOE, etc
	* Made Musical Strike/Slinging Arrow work while in ensembles. [Skotlex]
	* Oops, fixed the compile error. [Skotlex]
	* Various checks to prevent trying to send data to disconnected players in
	  clif_send [Skotlex]
	* Moved the auto-spell code from weapon attacks to skill_additional_effect
	  and skill_counter_additional_effect. [Skotlex]
	- The autospells will trigger for all skills/normal-attacks except those
	  with nk =1 (no damage skill) which is needed to prevent stuff like
	  heal, traps or dances from triggering it.
	- Does not affect SC_HINDSIGHT triggered spells.
	- NOT properly tested as of yet, report any abnormalities and skills it
	  should/should-not be working with.
	* Fixed the crash when attempting to target a Emperium. [Skotlex]
	* mob_spawn_guardian will now 'retry' to load the guild data five seconds
	  later if the guild info is not available at spawn time. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed disconnected chars appearing as GMs on the console. [Skotlex]
	* clif_send_sub won't try to send any data to disconnected chars now. [Skotlex]
	  (may fix possible buffer overflow crashes)
2005/09/07
	* According to the patch, enabled Butterfly wings in the Castles [Lupus]
	* Adjusted MAX_GUILD constant according to Skotlex's changes [Lupus]
	* Now when the castle owner guild id is loaded, and the guild is not in
	  memory, the map server will request it right away from the char server. [Skotlex]
	* Corrected Guild Extension to be +4 to the max guildmates per level. [Skotlex]
	* Changed the default max vending value to 1 Billion [Skotlex]
	* Inverted meaning of pvp_noguild and pvp_noparty flags. the default then
	  for all maps where they are not set is: You can't attack parties/guildmates
	  on pvp maps. [Skotlex]
	* Updated mapflag/pvp_noparty to mark only the gvg arenas. [Skotlex]
	* Added mapflag/pvp_noguild, by default includes all pvp arenas. [Skotlex]
	* Cleared up some of the warning messages on mob_spawn_guardian. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed the compile error on skill.c... [Skotlex]
	* Changed offensive song/dances target to BCT_ALL when invoked in pvp/gvg
	  grounds. [Skotlex]
	* Added unit flags UF_NOMOB, UF_NOPC to give better control on who gets
	  affected by ground skills [Skotlex]
	* Fixed the possible crash in map_foreachinpath. [Skotlex]
	* Removed the error message in mob_guardian_changeguild when the new guild
	  has ID 0, the mob will just be removed instead. [Skotlex]
2005/09/06
	* Changed Assumptio to target all players around target. Mobs are no longer
	  affected. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed battle_check_target fails on guild-mates in pvp maps. [Skotlex]
	* Reverted battle_check_target to prevent floras from hitting themselves
	  until a better scheme can be thought of. [Skotlex]
	* Reorganized battle_weapon_attack to allow counter/root from blocking
	  autotriggered skills (like TripleBlows/Sacrificial Ritual) [Skotlex]
	* Fixed that crash on mob_spawn_guardian. [Skotlex]
	* Added battle option gvg_traps_target_all, defaults to yes for now. [Skotlex]
	* Added Zoc's fix to @autotrade (which made traders unable to login again..
	  ever) [Skotlex]
	* Massive Guardian update. [Skotlex]
	- Rewrote the guardian stat-passing system to minimize the need of db
	  lookups. Should greatly reduce the heavy lagging during WoE.
	- Not properly tested (lack of resources), update at your own risk AND 
	  PLEASE report any crashes/problems.
2005/09/05
	* Fixed Endure. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed Harmonic Lick not adding status change resistant. [Skotlex]
	* Moved ensemble stats calculating from status_change_start to
	  skill_unitsetting (performance purposes) [Skotlex]
	* Fixed song/dance effects lasting 30 secs rather than 20. [Skotlex]
	  (still somewhat inefficient, needs better handling method)
	* Battle check target fix: Novices/Low levels being unable to target mobs. [Skotlex]
	* Temporarily made traps not target allies on gvg (Still up for dabate) [Skotlex]
	* Battle check target update: Summoned creatures won't be checked versus
	  their master, means you should be able to target them as if they were
	  normal enemies. [Skotlex]
	* Made Shield Chain long ranged (it has to be affected by pneuma/defender). [Skotlex]
	* Fixed both trader/seller not being saved when using autotrade. [Skotlex]
	* Added debug messages to figure out who is causing the rain of function
	  mismatches on deleting skill_timerskill. [Skotlex]
2005/09/04
	* Fixed Trade Bug (when Trade Window indication was wrong). Thanks to k3dt
	* Now Water Ball isn't affected by RAIN mapflag anymore. Also corrected
		caclulation of number of WB shots (was broken by a typo) [Lupus]
		- Rain has been removed from kRO long ago.
	* Now Safety Wall fails to protect against Acid Terror. [Skotlex]
	* Added battle_config option firewall_hits_on_undead (defaults to 1) [Skotlex]
	  The deal is that each time the skill triggers on an undead, this number
	  of hits will be dealt instead of just one.
	  PROs: With a value of 5 or so, vertical firewall will work completely.
	  CONs: A high value means the whole tile can be wasted killing a single mob.
	* Fixed working stealing with NOLOOT mapflag on. Thanks 2Lorky [Lupus]
	* Now Knockback won't work when the target is already dead (prevents
	  ghosts) [Skotlex]
	* BSS now targets every player in the area of effect (might be updated to
	  include mobs pending on further information) [Skotlex]
	* Acid terror is now considered a ranged attack. [Skotlex]
	* Crash fixes to the npc-whisper system. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed classchange-able Emperium/Guardians/Treasure Boxes, thanks to alsimons [DracoRPG]
	* Fixed songs/dances, updated Hip Shaker [DracoRPG]
	* Fixed some fields in sql-files\main.sql... Who the hell added back `broken`? The field
	  `attribute` is the good one! Also changed `fame` type to the same as `zeny` (same max
	  value in the source code, so samemax value in the SQL saves !) [DracoRPG
	* battle_check_target update: Fixed BCT_NOENEMY checks. [Skotlex]
	* Moved Mental Sensing bonus from pc_gainexp to mob_damage, it is now a
	  status effect which the mob itself needs to be inflicted with to take
	  effect (and everyone involved in killing it will benefit) [Skotlex]
	* Pets now won't move while casting (unless their master is like a screen
	  away or so) [Skotlex]
2005/09/03
	* Fixed speed calc for pushcart/stalk/dancing/singing. [Skotlex]
	* Some crash-fixes introduced by the rewritten status system. [Skotlex]
	* Adjusted the default gvg penalty values, added gvg_flee_penalty. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed skill_blown causing a dangling pointer in the map data. [Skotlex]
	  (I believe this is the actual cause of all the crashes as of late)
	* Fixed @autotrade venders not being saved after they sell an item. [Skotlex]
	  Now both characters are saved to prevent exploits, too.
	* Fix to mob_setdelayspawn, if lucky might help with the crashes as of late. [Skotlex]
	* Added status effect SC_WATK_ELEMENT, converts part of your weapon attacks
	  into a different element. Used in magnum break to give 10% fire damage
	  bonus to your attacks. [Skotlex]
	* Made firewall hits not have any "damage delay", it merely knockbacks. [Skotlex]
	* battle_check_target update: added novice/low-level pk prevention on
	  pk_mode [Skotlex]
	* testing new SVN location [MouseJstr]
2005/09/01
	* Entirely rewrote status_calc_pc and status_get_[stat] functions to have a clear code.
	  They all use shared status_calc_[stat] functions to handle SC effects, this will avoid
	  to have 2 almost identical codes in different places for those effects [DracoRPG]
	  --> It compiles, it runs, it seems to work but I couldn't perform any extended testing
	      as always, feel free to report bugs ;)
	* Added battle_option "slaves_inherit_speed" to decide whether slaves have
	  or not the same walk speed as their master. Defaults to yes. [Skotlex]
	* Removed val4 from song/dances so that they won't be as bugged anymore.
	  (still pending on Draco's status update, but at least now stuff like Poem
	  of Bragi shouldn't cause insta-cast) [Skotlex]
	* Changed the way song/dance status effects last. The first time you step
	  in a tile the status starts for 30 secs, not refreshed until it times out.
	  Not the way it really should be, but it's much better for performance
	  issues.
	* Fixed summoned slaves having the same walk-speed as their master (fixes
	  metamorphosis-hatched mobs from having an egg's speed). [Skotlex]
	* Added fix_timer_heap, should correct timer problems when the tick
	  overflows. Does it works? We'll find out in 48 days when the next
	  loop occurs. [Skotlex]
	* Another update to battle_check_target [Skotlex]
	  (Should fix slave-skills hitting a slave's master)
	* Corrected magic_damage_return code being double-invoked. [Skotlex]
	* clif_GM_kick will now invoke map_quit if the player doesn't has a session [Skotlex]
	  (this should fix @kick and other such commands on autotrade chars and the
	  like)
	* Fixed pc_damage/mob_damage returning 0 instead of damage dealt (which in
	  turn made all attack/skills not trigger their additional effects) [Skotlex]
	* Updated Assumptio to target everyone instead of "not enemies" [Skotlex]
	* Fixed a fatal dangling pointer in the mob_setdelayspawn when handling
	  mobs that don't respawn. [Skotlex]
	* Updated WE_CALLPARENT to not check for range (as it should?) [Skotlex]
	* Added flag accreg_dirty to identify when account variables have not been
	  saved yet, it'll retry then on every call to save the character (it will
	  prevent account variables from being lost when the char/map connection is
	  not established)
2005/08/31
	* Updated @npctalk to work as it should [Skotlex]
	- Usage @npctalk NPC Name, Your Message Goes here
	* Fixed Wind Walk's flee/speed bonus (as pointed out by Viccious Pucca). [Skotlex]
	* Fixed a crash in pc.c when the last save point was not found (thanks to
	  Foruken) [Skotlex]
	* Rewrote map_foreachinpath, it should work mostly right now. [Skotlex]
	  (the path 'stops' at the destination point rather than keep going
	  forward, but it can probably be fixed later)
	* Moved battle_config spawndelay adjustments from mob.c (calculating it
	  each time they were killed) to npc.c (calculate it once during parsing).
	  [Skotlex]
	* Synchronized additional status effects with the delayed damage [Skotlex]
	  (this should fix eg: enemies freezing when you start the attack
	  animation, and then breaking the ice when your attack animation finishes
	  and the damage shows up)
	* Moved knockback to effect after damage is applied. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed the Wedding Skills not displaying the actual amount healed. [Skotlex]
	* Moved skill induced status effects to take effect before knock back. [Skotlex]
	* Refixed "Don't Forget Me" [Skotlex]
	* Changed 'pet_hair_style''s description and default value to 100 [Skotlex]
	  (100 is the value being reported to work with current clients)
	* Fixed Freeze 'counter' not resetting when killed. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed Endure adding to mdef2 instead of mdef. [Skotlex]

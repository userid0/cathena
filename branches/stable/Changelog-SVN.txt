	* Added a random modifier to returned damage modifiers to prevent stun-lock
	  abusers. [Skotlex]

	  feedback appreciated.
	* Updated missing grfio.c, sorry ^^; and thanks Skotlex! [celest]
	* Fixed crash in exporting ip address to plugins [celest]

06/15
	* Small mod on the new attack function to prevent Asura Strike from
	  overflowing and doing minimal damage instead of insane damage. [Skotlex]
	* Merged Iro's patch to get #changesex working. Try it out. [Skotlex]
	* nullpo fix (guild.c:550), it was an actual possible scenario when you

	  charcommand. [Skotlex]
	* Small fix regarding speed updating for Cast Cancel + Freedom of Cast [Skotlex]

06/14
	* Various item_trade restriction fixes:	[Skotlex]
	  - Fixed guild/normal storage flags not working right.
	  - Fixed a bug which allowed players to store items regardless of
	    restrictions.
	  - Modified the gm override level behaviour on trades so a high level gm
	    can both give and receive the otherwise untradeable item.
	* Small fix to the sql-files/convert_guild_tables.sql script.	[Skotlex]
	* Modified function status_calc_speed to be faster since it's only used for
	  cloaking and freedom of casting.	[Skotlex]
	* Changed the stacking type from speed-bonuses to make it harder to reach max
	  walk speed.	[Skotlex]
	* Fixed a bug on the way aspd bonuses stack.	[Skotlex]
	* Changed map names length from 24 to 16 all over the char(txt/sq) and map
	  servers, this could fix the "matrix" bug (if done right...).	[Skotlex]
	* General cleanup and memory checks on char server (txt)	[Skotlex]
	* Miscellanous memory checks around charcommand.c and atcommand.c [Skotlex]

	* Fixed characters not being able to uncloak

	  is now plugin_athena.conf and so on [celest]
	* Updated UPnP plugin to 1.0.3.1 [celest]
	  - moved code in socket.c back into the plugin
	  - added configuration file support (plugins/upnp.conf) -- you'll need to do
	    'make plugins' to install it
	* Added 'make zlib' for compiling a zlib.dll [celest]

06/13
	* Fixed Asura Strike possibly doing minimal damage when it should do very
	  large damage instead.	[Skotlex]
	* Fixed another possible crash on chrif... [Skotlex]
	* Applied Maeki's fix for Guild Sql Char server	[Skotlex]
	  if it breaks, go stone him :X (I already got enough rocks to watch
	  out for...)
	* Made berserk-cancels-users-other-self-buffs a battle_config 
	  option, default: off [Aru]
	* Some compiler warnings fixes	[Skotlex]
	* Added battle_config option equip_natural_break_rate. [Skotlex]

	* Char-Sql server	revision [Skotlex]
	  Miscellanous memory bounds/overflows checks/fixes.
	* Fixed options start_armor/start_weapon (char sql)	[Skotlex]
	* Some more map server memory checks and cleanup (90%) [Skotlex]
	* Fixed cloaking re-cloaking you instead of cancelling cloak. [Skotlex]
	* Double Damage multiplier applied after vit/def reductions until further
	  information is available. [Skotlex]
	* Restored previous speed stacking type until a fix for the new method can
	  be devised. [Skotlex]
	* Removed MVP status from @summon'd monsters. [Valaris]
	* Had the "monster target reset to none" code inside of check for the monster level up code, moved it out. [Valaris]
	* Added update of mob hp display on monster level up if mob hp display and monster leveling are on. [Valaris]
	* Added mob_clear_delay option to battle_athena.conf.
	  Can add a delay before sending monster death packet (time is in milliseconds and default 0 is off).
	  Increasing this can fix the problem with monster sprites still appearing after it died.  Recommended value: 10. [Valaris]
	* Fixed spawning multiple sized monsters via scripts. [Valaris]
	* Added LittleWolf's mode 256 (0x100 internally) for monsters (adds detect hidden to a monster, doesn't have to be an MVP, demon or insect). [Valaris]
	* Fixed bug allowing players to cast warp portal under players and other various invalid blocks. [Valaris]
	* Removed talk conversion of Zherlthsh and Alice pets since clients now support them.  Thanks to Kholdstare for pointing it out. [Valaris]
	* Added "ORDER BY" statement to char-server SQL's reading of the memo db, fixing problems with people's memo lists
	  screwing up when they log back in.  Not sure if this problem exists in TXT char-server as well. [Valaris]
	* Map server memory cleanups... (85%) [Skotlex]
	* Removed battle option "enemy_critical" [Skotlex]
	  Use enemy_critical_rate=0 instead.
	* Changed the default of enemy_critical_rate to 0 [Skotlex]
	* Ported oA's imalive and flushtimer system to eAthena plugin 'gui' [celest]
	  - You will only need the plugin if you are using a gui program like wxOAGUI
	    to run Athena
	  - To configure it check addons/gui.conf
	  - Passing "--gui" as a parameter, i.e "./map-server --gui" will activate it
	    as well (GUI program creators, you should handle this transparently)
	* Added get_uptime to timer.c -- used by @uptime and the 'sig' plugin [celest]
	* Merged the 'uptime' plugin into 'dump' and renamed to 'sig' -- it'll now
	  handle both crash and uptime logging [celest]
	* Guild SQL updated again, `exp` and `next_exp` to BIGINT UNSIGNED [CLOWNISIUS]
	* Updated the guild_upgrade made sure UNIQUE KEY guild_id is implemented [CLOWNISIUS]
	* Pets no longer lose intimacy when you die on a nopenalty map [Aru]

06/12
	* Removed the dynamic mob messages (mobs spawned/removed) from default output [Skotlex]
	  (Use battle_config etc_log to enable them again)
	* Fixed sql-files/convert_guild_tables.sql so that it actually works	[Skotlex]
	  (works only on non-modified guild tables previous the new guild system)
	* Small nullpo fix on @where. 
	* Fixed new account flood protection blocking _M/_F registration (txt/sql) [Skotlex]
	  The bug? The default disallowed time was 1 registration every 10K secs.
	* Found & fixed the bug that was causing server instability on clif.c [Skotlex]
	* Cloaked characters will uncloak on attack/skill-use [Skotlex]
	* Fix on aspd_rate affecting skills not working [Skotlex]
	* Miscellanous small fixes in map server.	[Skotlex]
	
	* The new attack function is now the unchangeable default. [Skotlex]
	* Updated double_rate (side-winder) behaviour.	[Skotlex]
	  It no longer adds to double attack's skill rate, instead the higher of
	  the two will be used on the currently equipped weapon.
	* Dec Agi now cancels Cart-Boost and viceversa as explained by Ishizu [Skotlex]
	* Cloaked characters now can't pick items. [Skotlex]
	* Made the max speed rate a battle_config option, default 300% [Skotlex]
	* Fixed the overflowed valstr free on skill.c:8840 [Skotlex]

06/11
	* Lord Knight's Beserk now cancels all the caster's other 
	  self-buffs when used. It also cannot be re-used during the
	  no-SP-recovery penalty period after it expires. (This penalty 
	  will now cancel on your death however.) [Aru]
	* Reverted the previous stacking type for aspd as per rodatazone
	  information [Skotlex]
	  Speed modifiers, however, still stack on the new way as there's been
	  complains of characters reaching impossibly high walk speeds.
	* Modified bAspdAddRate code so that it stacks linearly. [Skotlex]
	* Changed default stacking type for skill modifiers [Skotlex]
	  If you have +50 aspd and +50aspd you won't get 100% aspd, instead now you
	  get 50% of the 50%, that is 75% aspd bonus. Changed meant to protect
	  against stacking skills to get impossibly high walking speed/attack
	  speeds.
	* Modified the way bAspdRate & bSpeedRate work. [Skotlex]
	  They are meant to be non-stackable, so only the card/equipment with the
	  highest bonus prevails.(items with stackable bonus should use
	  bAspdAddRate & bSpeedAddRate instead.)
	* Changed the DoppelGanger Card definition from bAspdRate to bAspdAddRate
	  to make it stackable. [Skotlex]
	* Capped walkspeed at 4x default [Aru]
	* Added Maeki's awesome convert_guild_tables.sql
	  You must still manually add the `char_id` field to the `guild`
	  table and fill it with the guildmasters' char_ids BEFORE
	  running it. [Aru]
	* Removed inter_guild_storage_delete calls from int_guild, 
	  innodb tables make it unneccessary [Aru]
	  
06/10
	* Updated the default pet_db.txt support values	[Skotlex]
	  We don't have an official list of the support rates, but 1% as default
	  (1.5% if they have max intimacy) is just ridiculous.
	* More map server memory cleanups... (70%) [Skotlex]
	* Fixed that crash upon login.... 	[Skotlex]
	* More map server memory cleanups...  (45%) [Skotlex]
	* More map server memory bound cleanups and checks (35%) [Skotlex]
	* Fixed Stalkers being able to use (plagiarized) ground-target
	  skills from Chase Walk
	* Fixed come confusion between MVPs (status_get_mexp) and 
	  mini-bosses (mode & 0x20) in battle.c
	* Added battle_config option item_use_interval with default 500ms [Skotlex]
	* Started map server memory bounds checking for overflows (20%) [Skotlex]
	* Small optimizations on ensemble skills [Skotlex]
	* Fixed some compile warnings on char-sql server [Skotlex]
	* Added script function getitemslots(item_id);	[Skotlex]
	* Fixed a bunch of script functions generating a new dummy item instead of
	  failing when the item was not found.	[Skotlex]
	* Fixed mobhp display so that it will be displayed no matter which /showname option a player is using. [Valaris]
	* Fixed names with disguises (I tested it. It works. No more bitching. :P). [Valaris]
	* Completely overhauled SQL guild code to use innodb type tables
	  unfortunately, old guild tables are not compatible.
	  If you don't mind the data loss, wipe your current guild 
	  tables and run guild_tables.sql to create new guild tables. 
	  [Aru and CuteBoi]
	* If you want to manually convert your old guild tables, you'll
	  need to add the foreign keys from guild_tables.sql to the 
	  databases. And add the `char_id` field to the guild table.
	  Its value needs to be the char_id of the guildmaster [Aru]
	* Added 'alchemist' mob skill condition [celest]
	* Rewrote most of the old jA Self Destruction code [celest]

06/09
	* Fixed a possible null_po in clif.c:7714 caused by lagged clients [Skotlex]
	* Fixed enemy damage_delay being modified by 400 instead of 100. [Skotlex]
	* Changed behaviour of map_freeblock/map_freeblock_unlock as the previous
	  way seems to cause memory leaks. [Skotlex]
	* Tidied up code relating to skill_get_inf2() [Skotlex]
	* skill_db.txt updated. New inf2 values:	[Skotlex]
	  16: Guild skill, 32 Song/Dance skill, 64: Encore skill
	* Other misc arrangements to skill_db.txt (see db/Changelog) [Skotlex]
	* Tidied up code relating to skill_get_nk()	[Skotlex]
	* Readded the previously removed skills from item_db [Skotlex]
	* getpetinfo(2) will return "null" on no pet. [Skotlex]
	* Tidied up code relating to skill_get_inf() [Skotlex]
	* Some small fixes to @grind, @useskill [Skotlex]
	* Added fist (bare hands) to the list of unbreakable equipment in
	  pc_break_equipment	[Skotlex]
	* Reestructured battle_config options for equipment breaking [Skotlex]
	  Removed equipment_breaking and added equip_self_break_rate,
	  equip_skill_break_rate. Read battle_athena.conf for more info.
	* Fixed getpetinfo(2) crash. [Skotlex]
	* Added a couple missing lines from my PSIBlade merge of disguises. Name, attacking 
	  and such are fixed now with disguises. [Valaris]
	* Added battle_config option to set if advanced job skills may be plagiarized
	* Fixed ASC_BREAKER to ignore race/size/element cards like it should
	* Changed @fakename so it no longer needs to teleport the client to work [celest]
	* Removed the old day/night system that uses the blind effect [celest]
	* Fixed day/night cycles with darkness_level on not refreshing properly [celest]
	* Fixed pc_follow_timer cancels if the player or the target warps [celest]
	* Added @follow on the same target for the 2nd time will stop following [celest]
	* Added Memory manager will perform a hash check when freeing memory, by
	  End_of_exam / jA 1213 -- fixes crashes when a pointer created by level 2 ALLOC
	  is passed to level 1 aFree

06/08
	* Updated idle time considerations. [Skotlex]
	  A character's idle time is reset upon: Walking, attacking (auto-attack
	  counts too), using a skill or using a item.
	* idle_no_share changed from a Yes/No setting to # of seconds before
	  considering character idle (no/0 still disables). [Skotlex]
	* Updated idle_no_share description in battle_athena.conf
	* Modified @disguise so that it will always work with Npc/Mob names and Mob
	  Ids. Only npc by id is hardcoded for now.	[Skotlex]
	* Added atcommands cleanmap, npctalk, pettalk to atcommand_athena.conf with their
	  description.	[Skotlex]
	* Fixed spawn delays for anthell eggs	[Skotlex]

	  Komurka [Skotlex]
	* GM used Type 11 items will be exempt from the "GMs can do whatever they
	  want" rule regarding skill_usage because otherwise the used item is never
	  consumed.	[Skotlex]
	* Fixed Ice Falchion/Firebrand giving skills, they just cast the spell [Skotlex]
	* Reduced Ice Falchion's freezing chance from 5% to 1% [Skotlex]
	* Added Makefile caching [celest]
	  'Makefile.cache' is created when you compile for the first time, and keeps
	  all your makefile definitions so it can be read directly when you recompile,
	  instead of redetecting things one-by-one.
	  'Make [char_sql/login_sql/map_sql]' will now work properly too.
	  NOTE: A cache file created by compiling txt is NOT compatible with SQL, but
	  a cache created by SQL is compatible with TXT! Delete the cache file first
	  and compile SQL before TXT if you have to.
	* Skills will reset at level down. [davidsiaw]

06/07
	* Temporary change of the way mob memory is removed when they don't have a
	  respawn time (check for memory leaks fixed after killing all summoned mobs)
	  [Skotlex]
	* Fixed map_quit being called twice when a player requests to change char [Skotlex]

	* Re-fixed sql-files/item_db.sql [Skotlex]

	  - Changed some cloaking/chasewalk checks
	  - Fixed memory leak when map cache reading has an error
	  - Fixed a bug when receiving member info for an empty guild
	  - Skip still connecting players in clif_foreachclient()
	* Weather will now properly appear/disappear without having to refresh the client. [Valaris]
	* Complete monster disguise re-code: [Valaris]
	  -No more client crashes in PVP caused by disguises.
	  -Can view own attack/hit/cast/sit/turn animations.
	  -Monster sprite syncs up better than before.

		 it would allow them to use an ensemble.

06/06
	* Fixed and updated sql-files/item_db.sql to match with the current
	  db/item_db.txt	[Skotlex]
	* Removed variables with prefix "l" being treated as a temporary
	  variables by the scripting engine.	[Skotlex]
	* Updated description of idle_no_share battle_config option	[Skotlex]

06/05
	* Added more debugging information to login-in characters to track down the
	  authook nullpo problem.	[Skotlex]
	* Added a temporary string length check on trade-request.	[Skotlex]
	  (reports seem to indicate that the map-server garbage text bug could be
	  related to trading string length overflow, check the map-server output
	  for "name too long" messages).
	* Fixed a few Visual Studio compile errors and warnings - not completely fixed [Codemaster]
	* prevent_logout is now overriden by dead characters.	There's no point in
	  waiting 10 secs since you were killed to quit/change character. [Skotlex]
	* Passive mobs will now unlock their target once it's dead/gone too
	  far/in another map.	[Skotlex]
	  Passive mobs are supposed to be defensive, not vengeful. Do report of any
	  abuses that might be possible from this to take proper measures.
	* Fixed pet lures always failing (oops) [Skotlex]
	* Corrected Various Jur's (id 1264) equip script to bonus2 [Skotlex]
	* Fixed status_get_speed always returning 1000 when invoked on NPCs [Skotlex]
	* Added battle_config option pet_support_min_friendly [Skotlex]
	  Specifies minimum pet intimacy/friendly value needed before attacking.
	  Default 900, see battle_athena.conf for more information.
	* Some reorganizing of pet-catching code	[Skotlex]
	* Now mobs will do the /ag emotion when you use a lure on them and they
	  can't be caught (wrong lure, or mob not in the mob_db.txt).	[Skotlex]
	* Fixed a timer mismatch situation with pc_walk timers [Skotlex]
	* Re-structured the pc_follow_timer code	[Skotlex]
	* Updated the pet_heal_timer code to match behaviour with
	pet_supportskill_timer's one	[Skotlex]
	* Added support for universal lure. [Skotlex]
	  Use use_script "pet 0;" to create an item that will catch any non-boss
	  mob (will work as long as said mob has an entry in mob_db.txt, of course)
	  From what I read in the code, mapping multiple entries in mob_db.txt to
	  the same egg_id should work, so it should be possible to have all mobs as
	  pets using a single egg_id item and this custom lure.
	* Updated Weapon Repair from jA 1228 [celest]
	* Fixed TXT char disconnecting when sent a server packet from SQL map [celest]
	* Fixed login failing with md5 encryption, thanks to End_of_exam
	* Fixed lock_fclose() failing in Win32 builds, thanks to End_of_exam
	* Updated sql-files/mob_db.sql to match with db/mob_db.txt	[Skotlex]

	* Fixed Grandcross/DarkCross to do 3 hits instead of 4 [Skotlex]

	  - added 'make [common/map/login/char] options' -- only for txt though ^^;
	  - readded sse, mmx and o3 optimisation flags (disabled by default) -- you'll
	    have to edit and enable them yourself

06/04
	* Moved @charchangesex to #changesec *still disabled*. [Kevin]
	* Fixed a major security hole in the mail system, thanks to Valaris for the info =). [Kevin]
	* Moved @charsk/stpoint to #sk/stpoint. [Kevin]
	* Moved @charmodel to #model. [Kevin]
	* Moved @charst/skreset to #st/skreset. [Kevin]
	* Re-updated sql-files/item_db.sql to use price buy/sell NULL instead of 0	[Skotlex]
	  The file is full of REPLACE instead of INSERT, so if you already have the
	  structure of the table right, you can just delete the table definition
	  and apply the file to update your item_db table.
	* Commented out char_athena.conf. [Kevin]
	* Moved @charlostskill to #lostskill. [Kevin]
	* Moved @charquestskill to #questskill. [Kevin]
	* status_change_start will halt silently instead of printing null_po messages
	  when trying to apply  status effects on pets	[Skotlex]
	  (Fixes null_po's from pets doing magnum break and who knows what other
	  skills)
	* Moved #showexp and #showdelay to @showexp and @showdelay. [Kevin]
	* Moved @charjoblvl and @charbaselvl to #joblvl and #baselvl. [Kevin]
	* Readded the cloth dye packet upon-walk. Sorry about that [Skotlex]
	* Fixed Party Exp Even Share	[Skotlex]
	* Added #fakename, due to popular demand =)[Kevin]
	* Clothe dye is updated now on view_class change	[Skotlex]
	  Most noticeable effect: Dye is not lost un unequipping a tuxedo/wedding dress.
06/03
	* Updated sql-files/item_db.sql to match with the current db/item_db.txt [Skotlex]
	* Added some initialization code regarding dynamic mobs during map startup. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed the typo on Thief's Sling Stone quest (Zargon->Garlet)	[Skotlex]
	  Why noone fixed this before? o.O
	* Removed a piece of code that updates your cloth's dye whenever you walk.
	  I have been testing for a bit, and this piece of code seems unneeded, and
	  not only that, it causes quite a bandwidth penalty by sending
	  dye-changing packets every time every character walks!	[Skotlex]
	  If you get reports that the characters are getting displayed their
	  default color instead of their selected dye, report it so I add back that
	  piece of code (but it would be best if we could do without it, it would
	  save quite some bandwidth).
	* Some compiler fixes in older versions of GCC, thanks to esca.
	* Some optimizations to petskill_use	[Skotlex]
	* Fixed the default max hair dye color count, it is 8, not 9 @.@	[Skotlex]

	to "no" or 0.	[Skotlex]
	* Fixed gm chat kick protection.	[Skotlex]
	* 'Tidied' a bit party_exp_share (more like restructured it).	[Skotlex]
	* Re-added party_idle_no_share code. When was it removed? [Skotlex]
	* Added skills going damanage when PVP isn't on fix. [Kevin]
	* Fixed the party-even-share bonus for large parties. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed gm chat kick protect.[Kevin]
	* GM of higher or equal level can use @where on another GM.[Kevin]
	* Fixed @fakename command.[Kevin]
	* Stopped the map-server from invoking "OnAgitStart" each time it connects
	to the char server.	[Skotlex]
	* Modified Abracadabra code to make it work with Pet Skills	[Skotlex]
	  (Warning: Not yet tested)
	* fixed a bug with Abracadabra
06/02
	* fixed compile issues on older gcc, thanks to esca [Shinomori]
	* Added @size and @fakename gm commands. [Kevin] 
	* Added valaris's getstrlen and charisalpha functions into the script parser. [Kevin]

06/01
	* Fixed Divest Shield and Divest All not able to strip shields [DracoRPG]
	* Changed the default max_hitrate to 100% as specified in rodatazone [Skotlex]
	* Removed the console messages printed when the script command getmapxy is
	  invoked	[Skotlex]
	* Fixed non-droppable items blocking the client from further droping 
	  other items	[Skotlex]
	* Changed the default of mob_remove_delay to 5 mins	[Skotlex]
	* Changed the minimum mob_remove_delay to 15 secs since mobs with instant
	  respawn actually take 5~10 secs to respawn	[Skotlex]
	* Fixed again disp_hpmeter, it looks like this time it works properly. [Skotlex]
	* Added Esca's fixes to make eA properly compile under Sun-OS	[Skotlex]
	* Tested and fixed script function getnameditem	[Skotlex]
	  Now you can use getnameditem(item,char) to get inscribed equipment (only
	  works with what you can equip, arrows excluded). The item description can
	  be the item id or the item name, and the character can as well be the
	  character id or character name. Function returns 1 if successful and
	  the character who's name is to be inscribed HAS to be online.
	* Changed the way dynamic mobs are removed. Now all mobs have are tagged as
	  either cached/uncached, and only those cached are removed	[Skotlex]
	  Mob-Slaves are the only non-cached enemies that are also tagged as
	  cached.
	* Fixed a delete_timer mismatch in pet.c	[Skotlex]
	* Fixed some compile time things in older versions of gcc. [Kevin]
	* Removed the clif message when you can't drop items [Skotlex]
	  Apparently this message breaks the clients and prevents further drops of
	  items? Might need further testing.
	* Changed AspdRate and SpeedRate bonuses so they can stack [DracoRPG]
	* Added script function getnameditem	[Skotlex]
	  syntax: getnameditem itemid, inscribed char's name
	  Needed at least for wedding scripts. Only works on equippable items,
	  returns 1 on success, always makes only 1 item.
	  (it should also be able to use char's id or item's name instead)
	  Script function proof-read but not yet tested, so it might have a bug or
	  two, use at your own risk for now.
	* Fixed dynamic mobs removing Guardians [Skotlex]
	* Fixed sql queries in logs giving an error. [Kevin]
	* Fixed @memo ignoring the nomemo map flag, thanks to Maeki. [Kevin]
	* Enabled an account flood protection system defaulting to 1 account every 10 seconds. [Kevin]
	* Corrected dynamic mob unloading to remove slaves. [Skotlex]
	* Added Maeki's fix for handling the sql connection to the log server [Skotlex]
	* A reminder to people who seem to have a broken item_db (wrong item
	  sprites, doing nothing on click, etc): there was an update to item_db
	  some days ago, a new column which is used to determine refineable 
	  items (which goes between eLv and View) The shipped item_db.txt is
	  already updated, but if you have custom files, you can try updating
	  them using the gawk line (further below this changelog) or this short
	  sed command (from within the db directory):
	  gsed -re 's/([^,]*,){16}/&,/' < item_db.txt > item_db.fix
	  And then replace item_db.txt with the newly created file (if ya don't
	  have gsed, try sed. All *nix should come with one or the other, and you
	  can also get it with cygwin)
	* Moved the dynamic mob spawns/deletes to map_addblock/map_delblock [Skotlex]
	  This pretty much guarantees that mobs won't be spawned/deleted twice from
	  the same map.
	* Added random's battle_config flag for enabling/disabling dynamic mobs [Skotlex]
	  Dynamic mobs is good for medium to small servers, but on large ones it
	  gets to be somewhat pointless.
	* Fixed disp_hpmeter, I think (can't test it, but the code looks ok) [Skotlex]
	* Added battle athena option mob_remove_delay [Skotlex]
	  Now dynamic mobs are not removed inmediately, but after some time has
	  passed. Default value is 60 secs
	* Added debugging information about dynamic mobs [Skotlex]
	  Helps keep track of how many mobs are being removed/spawned, use it to
	  track any possible bugs! Should be removed after dynamic mobs are good
	  enough.
	* Some changes to dynamic mob unloading to avoid remove summoned mobs and
	always remove mob slaves.	[Skotlex]
	* Fixed a nasty pc.c bug thanks to komurka [massdriller]
	* Added Sasuke's modification to allow certain gm levels to see the 
	  hp bars [massdriller]

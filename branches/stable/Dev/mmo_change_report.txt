Okay,

please report changes in the mmo.h to this file (changelog),
currently i'm coding the new charserver, so i must know the changes for protocoll
compatiblity!


Thx Sirius





Date / Changed(Added)
10/June: Use NAME_LENGTH instead of 24 if you are gonna use any name-length
checking. Also, that number 24... actually means 23 characters + null
terminator. I believe RO actually allows for 24 characters in their names, so
it needs to be changed to 25 (and will do so after I update all the code all
over the place to use NAME_LENGTH instead of hard-coded 23/24's)
14/June: Use MAP_NAME_LENGTH for map names. There was an inconsistency on this
length on the map server: at times it is 24, at others it is 16 in length. I
am going to standarize it to 16 (but just check for the value of the constant)

21/July: Use the new friend structured (struct friend), the friend system
works based on char_id, account_id AND name, so storing char_id/name was not
enough. [Skotlex]
Also the fame-list sending has changed, the char server needs to send the
names. The new packet is a lot like the previous one, except that instead of
sending individual fields, the whole struct fame_list of each smith/chem is
saved into the packets. [Skotlex]

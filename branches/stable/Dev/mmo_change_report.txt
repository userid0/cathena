Date / Changed(Added)
10/June: Use NAME_LENGTH instead of 24 if you are gonna use any name-length
checking. Also, that number 24... actually means 23 characters + null
terminator. I believe RO actually allows for 24 characters in their names, so
it needs to be changed to 25 (and will do so after I update all the code all
over the place to use NAME_LENGTH instead of hard-coded 23/24's)

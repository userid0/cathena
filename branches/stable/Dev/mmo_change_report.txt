Okay,

please report changes in the mmo.h to this file (changelog),
currently i'm coding the new charserver, so i must know the changes for protocoll
compatiblity!


Thx Sirius





Date / Changed(Added)
10/June: Use NAME_LENGTH instead of 24 if you are gonna use any name-length
checking. Also, that number 24... actually means 23 characters + null
terminator. I believe RO actually allows for 24 characters in their names, so
it needs to be changed to 25 (and will do so after I update all the code all
over the place to use NAME_LENGTH instead of hard-coded 23/24's)
14/June: Use MAP_NAME_LENGTH for map names. There was an inconsistency on this
length on the map server: at times it is 24, at others it is 16 in length. I
am going to standarize it to 16 (but just check for the value of the constant)

21/July: Use the new friend structured (struct friend), the friend system
works based on char_id, account_id AND name, so storing char_id/name was not
enough. [Skotlex]
Also the fame-list sending has changed, the char server needs to send the
names. The new packet is a lot like the previous one, except that instead of
sending individual fields, the whole struct fame_list of each smith/chem is
saved into the packets. [Skotlex]

August 03
The char server keeps track of which is the max account/char id currently in
use, and notifies the map server when said max has changed (using packet
0x2b07), this is used to help the map server identify the validity of incoming
players. The initial values for said max are DEFAULT_MAX_ACCOUNT_ID and
DEFAULT_MAX_CHAR_ID (which give room for 10K accounts and 100K players before
it needs to be updated) [Skotlex]

August 25
struct guild_storage got added the "dirty" entry to know when to save it
(shouldn't affect save/load, though). [Skotlex]

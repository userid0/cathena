The idea is to use LUA (http://lua.org) as scripting language for NPCs etc, but not only this...
GM Commands would also be scripted this way, allowing server admins to create their own @commands!


First, the header is read by eAthena. If needed (NPCs, area NPCs, GM Commands), the header points
to a LUA function that can be defined anywhere inside a script file. Available headers would be :

GM Command:
	gmcmd	CommandName	triggered_lua_function_name
Usual NPC:
	npc	NPC Name	mapname.gat X Y direction sprite triggered_lua_function_name
Area script (e.g. for traps):
	area	Area Name	mapname.gat X1 Y1 X2 Y2 triggered_lua_function_name
Shop NPC:
	shop	Shop Name	mapname.gat X Y direction sprite itemid1:price1,itemid2:price2,...
Warp:
	warp	Warp Name	map1name.gat X1 Y1 map2name.gat X2 Y2 Xrange Yrange sprite
(and maybe others ^^)

Then, you can define as many LUA functions as you want, and they will be available for calls
from NPCs, GM Commands and others ^^ We will need to add every needed scripting command to
available LUA functions, which won't be so hard since LUA is exactly done for this...

Well, this is only the idea I got, you are free (and asked !) to give comments and feedback !

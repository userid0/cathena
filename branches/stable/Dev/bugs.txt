** PLEASE WRITE CLEARLY WHAT THE PROBLEM IS AND HOW TO DUPLICATE IT SO IT CAN BE FIX0RED. THANK YOU **

Problem:	Something with character data searching on connect to char server, prints out the line 
	"[Error]: Character request data search error! Character 150227 (account 2051597) not authentified." thousands upon thousands of times and goes by SO fast,
	then it never fixes its self.

Note:	Maybe just need to disconnect the person so it doesn't do in to an infinite loop?

Problem:	Creator's Acid Demonstration damage formula is completely wrong. The current "formula" is only a placeholder it seems.
Assigned: Skotlex
Progress: 99%
Note:		Noone knows the real formula, but the current one is a very good
  aproximation from all the empirical data collected by players.

Problem:	The map server crashes when a session gets timed out. Like, a player suddenly dc's after doing something, then the session is removed. 
Assigned:
Progess:
Note:		There hasn't been this kind of crash in decades? The current only
	connection problems are the map server dying under windows when a client
	causes 'software caused connection abort' errors. [Skotlex]

Problem:	Stats nor skills don't downgrade when your level gets reverted due to exp loss.

Assigned:       N/A
Progress:       0%

                spawn mob 1600..

                also

                add a flag to the monsters defs
                for example
                1002,1039 // makes a poring a bapho
                if it's like that nothing happens
                but if you do this
                1002,1039,1 // makes a poring a big bapho  
                1002,1039,2 // makes a poring a small bapho
                effect id or something
Note: The current mob spawn scripts should be good enough. The last field,
	"event", use 2 for small mobs, 4 for big ones. Also, this is fixed? I couldn't
	reproduce it. [Skotlex]

Problem:	This bug's appeared again: Permanent #Variables/Variables disappear.
			Quests, Banks, etc wipe when you create a new character

		We had no such a bug before, but Freya has it. Probably it soaked into eA with 
		Freya optimizations code...
Note:		Using no prefix (@, #, etc.) seems to make it permanant

Problem:	Exp Party Sharing Bug.
		i.g. Hunter + Merchant are in the same party. M. is sitting. Hunter is killing some Seals. M. doesn't get EXP.
		Then H. teleports to another map and hunts there. Now, M. kills a poring and get a huuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuge amount
		of EXP (like it was collecting... all the time he was sitting next to H.)

Problem:	Guilds alliances
		You can have any number of alliances entried in SQL db. Sometimes it glitches and you get > 4 alliances
Assigned:	N/A
Progress:	0%
Note:		Might be fixed? There was an incorrect check for limiting alliances
to 4, not 3. Which is the actual limit anyway? [Skotlex]

Problem:	Disguise Stats Bonus bug.
		try @disguise 1002 or 'bonus bDisguise,1002;' as a script in a wearable item. And then go in hide.
		You'll get +255 os ro bonuses for all stats and would kill LOD in one kick.
		It's a global bug.. comes from those times when WEDDING Class had such ++++bonuses
		So Wedding Class has been fixed, but not the source of the bug.

Problem:	[item exploit] Hunters can set traps not consuming the TRAPS ITEMS, when Bards
		use their special support skill.
		Then Hunters can collect these traps for free... And then sell, etc.
Assigned:	N/A
Progress:	50%
Note:	I added a check so that when you collect a trap during the 'Into the
	Abyss' skill effect, you won't receive the item. It ain't perfect, but.. is it
	good enough (other than disabling no-trap cost effect of the skill?) [Skotlex]
	Perhaps we can just add a flag for being made during an Into the Abyss song or not? [Codemaster]

Problem:	Speed hack and other proxy-like hacks
		they change/double selected packets for different exploits:
			dupe, multiattack (destroy Emp in 1 minute.) etc...
		We should check packets, should keep eye on frequency of users packets
			and ban / kick / log funkers

Problem:	If a char has been saved with non-existing map name
		then the server crashes on entering the game.
		the wrong names e.g. prontera.gat.gat
		could be generated on times when map server is disconnected with char server.
Note:		Perhaps we can create an array of the maps we have loaded (during loading, maybe?)
		And check the map names against that [Codemaster]

Problem:	Skill Delays Bug (Hunters)
		When you use a skill then Equip Another kind of arrows,
		you can immediately cast another SKILL. (Bind skills on hot keys and... u get a killing machine)
Assigned:	N/A
Progress:	0%
Note: Skill's delay is not affected by changing equipment from what I read.
	Apparently the bug is in the fact that certain skills have a way too low delay
	while the client normally doesn't lets you trigger said skills as fast? [Skotlex]

Problem:	Scripts prob
		We can't use jA's new commands: FOR, WHILE, ELSE, etc

Problem:	Sniper
		They have 2 skills to dismount traps: Emeny's and Our's.

Problem:	Wedding Skills (thousand brides...)
			The skills work even if PARTNER_ID of destination player doesn't coinside
			to CALLER
			in other words... if you aren't properly married.
			I'd suggest to CLEAR bugged Patner_id automatically
			And automatically remove wedding rings from not married players
			when they enter the server
Assigned:	NA
Progress:	0%
Note:		Perhaps on server start-up or shut-down, we should run a query to make an
		array of char IDs that are married and compare them against their Partner IDs,
		and remove the partner IDs that are not available in the array of char IDs
		that are married. [Codemaster]


Problem:	New Guilds Active Skills Abuse.
			You can re-enter the game and call guild skills again w/o delay since the delay is applied to the character
Assigned:	na

			Temp fix: All skills are blocked as soon as you log-in (as if you had

Problem: (script related) Using callfunc/callsub inside a Menu crashes the server.
Assigned:	None
Progress:	- 
	Using callfunc/callsub within a menu will cause the server to crash after the
	user has selected an entry (the menu does finish displaying correctly). I
	speculate that the return of the function is messing up the script resume point
	in these situations.
	This should be marked as "not going to solve" as Lua should fix all script
	related concerns once it's in place. [Skotlex]

Problem:	Select() sometimes returns a listening fd more than once when a client connects,
			so the 2nd one will fail on accept() and keep spamming "accept: bad file descriptor".
Assigned:
Progess:	0%
Note:		Seems to happen a lot to the login server... And no it doesn't have anything to do with
			ip changed, sockets timing out, read/writing to a non existant fd... it's just
			select() somehow keeps thinking there's a connection on listen_fd even after accepting it >.<

Problem:	Child + Papa + Mama EXP sharing exploit

Problem:	GVG Enemy Healing BUG
			During WOE, you can heal your enemy without SHIFT
Assigned:	na
Progress:	0%
Notes:	Can't be fixed. The server never tells the client "who is your enemy"
and "who is not". We just give'em the name to display, that's it. The current
"the attack cursor appears on my pet" error, likewise, is the client's fault.
So, in short, this one can't be fixed. (the most that can be done is block
support skills on your enemy on gvg grounds, but then what if you DO want to
cast it on them?) [Skotlex]

Problem:	[TARO Cards Skill]
			When your enemy starts walking randomly (due to some Taro Card),

Problem:	SQL Query errors (example: someone with the name Accutane-)
		It errors, I am sure, because of the tailing -
		I am presuming that someone didn't run the query as a mysql_real_query

		occuring, but it is a MAJOR problem (perhaps logs?)

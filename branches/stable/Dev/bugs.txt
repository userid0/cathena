Problem:	2-2-1 classes are regarded as Novicies by the game server. NPCs aren't taking them as thier jobs but if you the the NPC to do something for a novice class it works with the 2-2-1 like renters. Also if some one becomes high novice, if they use jobra they can become first jobs like a swordsman.

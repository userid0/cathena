Problem:	2-2-1 classes are regarded as Novicies by the game server. NPCs aren't taking them as thier jobs but if you the the NPC to do something for a novice class it works with the 2-2-1 like renters. Also if some one becomes high novice, if they use jobra they can become first jobs like a swordsman.

Ideas:		Codemaster - I believe that they register them as normal classes, but sets Upper as 1, so you can do things such as if(Upper == 1)

Problem:        Spiral Pierce can cause loss of Skill Points
Assigned:       N/A
Progress:       0%

    If you have a skill but due to a job change (or admin update), the
    skill tree changes and you no longer can get to that skill, you
    will loose the skill points if you log out/i

    The easiest way to reproduce this problem is become a Peco Lord
    Knight, get spiral pierce, get off the peco, log off, log in, and
    get back on the peco.  You will not have Spiral Pierce anymore and
    you will have lost the skill points

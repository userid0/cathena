- This is a small summary of the roles of trunk vs a branch, as well as their
  current state in eA. 

- Trunk: This should be the base source-codebase, well all the flashy lights
  and new enhacements get added. It gets updated a lot, breaks often.

- Current situation: Noone works on trunk anymore and it's seriously outdated.


- Branch: This should be a snapshot of the trunk at some given time, and
  receives no enhancements at all, only bug fixes. Once the branch becomes
  stable enough, it is "released" to the public with an appropiate version
  number, and the next branch is created from a new snapshot from the trunk.

- Current situation: Everyone is working on branches/stable s if it were a
  stable + development source.

As Akaru has pointed out, we need to sort this out inmediately:
- branches/stable must be moved and become the new trunk/
- We should probably make a branch snapshot from a few days ago (before the
  latest feature additions like string permanent variables?) for next release
  base.
- All devs should stick to the roles of branch/trunk.
- It appears most devs who have heard of this agree with Akaru, however the
  initial steps to clean up the SVN repository have yet to be taken. This task
  seems assigned to Kayla, maintainer of said repository.

Post your thoughts/ideas about here...
- [Skotlex] I think fixing skills counts as bug fixing, and goes to branch.
  But implementing missing skills should go to trunk.

The mob_db.sxc and item_db.sxc files contained here are meant to make db
updating easier by letting all devs access the same source. These files also
contain an additional tab to make it extremely easy to export and generate the
sql files that can be used to populate the SQL tables.

These files are editable by OpenOffice.org, which is a free Office suite
available to anyone. These files should perhaps be updated to the OASIS
document format in the near future.

Whenever you want to update the dbs, use these files and then export (export
the txt or sql version that you want, export them as a CSV file, just change
the extension afterwards).

You may want to edit the exported file before commiting as some lines will
have additional commas. In a good editor it would the painless to remove all
extra commas by using a single search/replace-type of query.

14.
Description:	Add encrypted password option in login-server.

Status:     	Blocked, no solution without limited client version.

Assignee:   	Yor

Notes:      	It's impossible to use encrypted password in the account file, if we want to authorise all client version.
            	Some clients use a (random) md5key and send a composed encrypted of the password.
            	So, these clients send a different encrypted password based on plain text password at every connection.
            	If the password is encrypted, we can not more compare with plain text.
            	The other solution can be to not authorise these clients. But, that will probably be the futur of ALL clients.
            	Reduce possibilities of client version isn't a good idea for the futur and for the compatibility (like use only plain text password client version).
            	Save in account the plain text and the encypted version use more memory for nothing, and don't add security.
            	Conclusion:
            		If you want protected your password, you must:
            		- protected you account file
            		- never send a password outside the server
            		- use only encypted client version (that send an encrypted password to server).

Description:	In script.c parser should be fixed to allow argumentless functions return value.

Status:     	Pending

Notes:      	Functions like "checkcart", "checkfalcon", "checkriding" don't return value if used without agruments or without "()".
            	Example: 'checkcart' always return Zero (because the parser doesn't recognize it as a function!)
            	Example: 'checkcart()' map server doesn't load (because argless funcs aren't in use)
            	As a temp fix Lupus added "*" in script.c in "checkcart", "checkfalcon", "checkriding" definitions.
            	To be able running them with any fake arg. i.e. checkcart(0) works fine!

Description:	Baby Skills

Stats:		Pending

Assignee:	NONE

Notes:		1. Skills
		- Come here, baby.
		( Summons the adoptee )
		- Mom, Dad, I love you.
		( For 5 minutes, the parent characters will not have EXP penalty upon death )
		- Mom, Dad, I want to see you.
		( Summons the parents )
		* For the summon skill, it works like wedding summon skill - it can only be done in areas where warps can be saved at.

		2. EXP Sharing
		- Only the parents and the child can EXP share; nobody else can be in the party. If any other person joins, the EXP share resets.
		- If you move to a different map, the EXP share resets.
		- The EXP returned is only 1/3rd of normal since both mother and father character has to be in the same party with the child.

		3. Changes after adoption
		- For the child character, the character becomes small.

		4. What happens if parents divorce
		- The parents can NEVER adopt another child ever again even after divorce + remarry.
		- The character child continues to be as it is (meaning, even if the child no longer has a parent, he or she will continue to be the 'child'), and only 1 child can be obtained per character.
		- Even if the child character is deleted, the parents can never get another child.
		* This means, when you adopt a child character, DO IT CAREFULLY. For the entire history of your character, you can only, and I mean ONLY get one child character. 

		- The Child Adoption system now changes as following, so please make note of this:
		* The adopted child cannot raise any stat to beyond 80. - Done [Celest]
		* The adopted child will have 70% of MaxHP and MaxSP of normal characters. - Done [Celest]
		* The adopted child cannot marry. - Done [Celest]
		* "Mom, Dad, I love you" skill will only last 2 minutes instead of 5.
		* The parents must be both LV 70 or above in order to adopt.
		* The parents must be both LV 70 or above in order to share EXP as family.
		* "Mom, Dad, I love you" skill will now take 10% of MaxSP instead of taking 1 SP.
		- The wedding skills will now depend on percentage of MaxHP/MaxSP.

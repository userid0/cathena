
If you are reading this, you are one of the lucky fools to be actually
using the active development tree of the eAthena team.   This is the
only version that most of the eA dev team will activly support.

svn can be retrieved via:

  http://subversion.tigris.org/files/documents/15/18114/svn-win32-1.1.1.zip

once downloaded and placed in your path, you can just do:

C> svn co http://dev.deltaanime.net:8080/svnroot/eathena/branches/stable

this will check out a copy of our active stable development tree which
you can then build.  Build? figure it out...

So, my server is crashing and I built it out of the svn stable
branch.. what do I do?

Each developer has their own feelings on supporting this tree and
how.  

Dev=> MouseJstr  (AIM: MouseJstr, Yahoo: MouseJstr, msn: joshs@stormbirds.org):

  If you are running linux and are experiencing crashing/coredumping,
  give me ssh access to your machine and I willhappily gdb your
  server, debug your cores, and place fixes back into the svn tree to
  make the system more stable. 

  In some cases, if the problem is very difficult to debug, I may wish
  to install a different compiler (in a different location) on your
  machine which may require root access 

  The cost?  Its free..  just work with me to make it better for
  everybody...

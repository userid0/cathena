				<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
					<b>Q: I get the error message "This application has failed to start because cygwin1.dll was not found. Re-installing the application may fix this problem."</b><br>
 						A: You're missing the cygwin dlls. Please get the latest dll at: http://www.cygwin.com/snapshot. If you're unsure, asking around in our IRC chatroom will get you around too, but always remember - use common sense and search before asking.<br><br>
					<b>Q: My map-server won't load! It appears to be loading things before it dissapeared suddenly! HELP!</b><br>
						A: Use command line to load map-server. It should tell you the error. If you're missing a map, update your kRO Sakray or comment the map from map_athena.conf. If you have an errornous NPC, fix it or comment it off. Anything other than that, feel free to ask around<br><br>

					<b>Q: My map-server failed to load 'adata.grf'! Where do I find this adata.grf? My map-server won't load without it!</b><br>
						A: The error that caused the map-server to not load is not the adata.grf. adata.grf is NOT a requirement for the map-server to load. The error is probably related to something else.<br><br>
					<b>Q: All 3 of the servers are loaded, but I am still having problems accessing it! What do I do?</b><br>
						A: First, check the IPs in map_athena.conf and char_athena.conf. If those are correct, check the ports to make sure they match. If that's correct too, you probably cannot handle the server load. Lower the monster spawning rate using mob_count in battle_athena.conf and it should be fine.<br><br>
					<b>Q: How do I start Guild Wars/War of Emperium??? HELP!!!</b><br>
						A: Read the GM Command page for full list of commands that GMs can use, including the command for this.<br><br>
					<b>Q: My Ragnarok Online crashed while playing with eAthena! What do I do now?</b><br>
						A: Well, if your Ragnarok crashes, it's most probably not anything to do with eAthena. Something is wrong with your Ragnarok installation. Try reinstalling or updating.<br><br>
					<b>Q: Is eAthena compatible with mySQL? Can I use mySQL as the DB instead of using text files?</b><br>
						A: Yes, eAthena is compatible with mySQL. A tutorial on how to setup this is coming soon.<br><br>
					<b>Q: Is eAthena compatible with msSQL? Can I use msSQL as the DB instead of using text files?</b><br>
						A: No, eAthena is not compatible with msSQL. You cannot use msSQL with eAthena.<br><br>
					<b>Q: I found a bug! Where do I report it?</b><br>
						A: Drop the developers a line at the IRC chatroom. Or just post it in the bug report forum. We check them out too. :)<br><br>
					<g>Q: I know alot of C and I'm able to help improve eAthena and add new features. How can I join your development team?</b><br>
						A: Try talking to one of the current developers in the eAthena channel.

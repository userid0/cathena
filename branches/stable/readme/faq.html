	<p class="main">
	<strong>Q: I get the error message "This application has failed to start because cygwin1.dll was not found. Re-installing the application may fix this problem."</strong>
    <br>
    A: You're missing the cygwin dlls. Please get the latest dll at: http://www.cygwin.com/snapshot. If you're unsure, asking around in our IRC chatroom will get you around too, but always remember - use common sense and search before asking.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Q: My map-server won't load! It appears to be loading things before it dissapeared suddenly! HELP!</strong><br>
    A: Use command line to load map-server. It should tell you the error. If you're missing a map, update your kRO Sakray or comment the map from map_athena.conf. If you have an errornous NPC, fix it or comment it off. Anything other than that, feel free to ask around<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Q: My map-server failed to load 'adata.grf'! Where do I find this adata.grf? My map-server won't load without it!</strong><br>
A: The error that caused the map-server to not load is not the adata.grf. adata.grf is NOT a requirement for the map-server to load. The error is probably related to something else.<br>
<br>
<strong>Q: All 3 of the servers are loaded, but I am still having problems accessing it! What do I do?</strong><br>
A: First, check the IPs in map_athena.conf and char_athena.conf. If those are correct, check the ports to make sure they match. If that's correct too, you probably cannot handle the server load. Lower the monster spawning rate using mob_count in battle_athena.conf and it should be fine.<br>
<br>
<strong>Q: How do I start Guild Wars/War of Emperium??? HELP!!!</strong><br>
A: Read the GM Command page for full list of commands that GMs can use, including the command for this.<br>
<br>
<strong>Q: My Ragnarok Online crashed while playing with eAthena! What do I do now?</strong><br>
A: Well, if your Ragnarok crashes, it's most probably not anything to do with eAthena. Something is wrong with your Ragnarok installation. Try reinstalling or updating.

<br>
<br>
<strong>Q: Is eAthena compatible with mySQL? Can I use mySQL as the DB instead of using text files?</strong><br>
A: Yes, eAthena is compatible with mySQL. A tutorial on how to setup this is coming soon.<br>
<br>
<strong>Q: Is eAthena compatible with msSQL? Can I use msSQL as the DB instead of using text files?</strong><br>
A: No, eAthena is not compatible with msSQL. You cannot use msSQL with eAthena.<br>
<br>
<strong>Q: I found a bug! Where do I report it?</strong><br>
A: Drop the developers a line at the IRC chatroom. Or just post it in the bug report forum. We check them out too. :)

<br>
<br>
<strong>Q: I know alot of C and I'm able to help improve eAthena and add new features. How can I join your development team?</strong><br>
A: Try talking to one of the current developers in the eAthena channel.

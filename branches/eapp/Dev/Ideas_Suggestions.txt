I (Ajarn) have loads of ideas. I might as well put them here. If no one does them it's fine, because I plan on doing them eventually if no one else does.

1) Better jail system. You know how the ban system has a time column,
   so you can set a certain amount of ban time? I think jailing should
   have this to. This way you can unjail the character when they are
   online or not, and jail them if they are on or not, etc. This will
   also lock their char to the jail until the state of that column is
   changed. One the time hits that they can come out (every min run a
   timer maybe?) they are unjailed if online, and if they are offline,
   the next time they log on it will check that column and unjail them
   then.


2) Addition to ban system. Ban works on a state system and I think ti
   should have another state. Instead of fully banning someone you
   should have the option of banning them from creating new chars
   before a full ban. This way you can jail their chars, and ban
   creation of new chars. Then they have to sit in the jail and talk
   it out with a GM. Gets problems solved easier.


3) Better gm level system. Basicly a gm command has group numbers
   after it (monster:1,5,99) and those gm levels can use it. This way
   you can have a much more flexible system. But when I think about
   it... it takes a lot of checking to do it that way, and in the long
   run, it would be a lot more flexible and easier to have account
   names after each gm command. I'm not sure which one I like, or
   which one should be used, but the "level" system is kind of hard to
   do when you want to have sistem levels. Like, some have group A
   commands, and some have group B commands, having nothing to do with
   group A. There is no way to do that with the current system.

	nsstrunks: The group numbers is kinda pointless, since
	currently if you set it to a higher number, everyone above
	that will have access. 

4) Private Message SPY! (@pmspy <char name>) What it does is you see
   everything that that person private messages to another, and
   anything another pms to them. I'm not sure if it can be already
   done, but this would stack with @guildspy and @partyspy. So, you
   you know thier party, and guild and you do all three spies, and you
   follow them around you can hear everything they are saying. 

5) Probably a stupid idea, but @localspy. It basicly spies on all the
   text that they can hear localy and sends it to you like "ajarn can
   hear: ....." and "ajarn says: ..." This way you can do #4 to a
   person, and then this, without following them, and get the same
   effect. 

6) We need another file for item_db.txt to keep there your custom items
   We already have the same thing is for mobs (mob_db2.txt)
	Why don't we use it?
	
7) New way to store/calculate EXP. Log of the idea:

Ancyker: exp
Ancyker: the way its stored
Ancyker: needs changed
Ancyker: currently it stores base level and exp
Ancyker: this is crap
Ancyker: it should store base level, and exp towards next level
Ancyker: so say u just level to level 5
Ancyker: ur level would be 5, and exp 0
Ancyker: u kill a poring
Ancyker: they give i beleive 10 exp
Ancyker: so now it would be 5 level, 10 exp
Ancyker: when u hit the marker, u gain a level
Ancyker: thats how the exp is stored in the fsking database
Ancyker: exp towards next level
Ancyker: not total exp
Ancyker: the problem with athena
Ancyker: it doesnt follow its own damn rules
Ancyker: it does a database one way
Ancyker: then totally changes it when it loads it
Ancyker: pick a damn method already

I (Ajarn) agree with him. It would make things so much easier server side too.


How to implement those ideas:

[Lupus]
1) You can make a script. Put OnTouch Area in the jail... when a banned person gets into jails, you set a global VAR.
 Then use PCLoginEvent.txt to check TIME/DATE and free that poor person when it's OK.
 So it's pretty easy to make with scripting. And even more... some private servers already have such scripts
 and even make the prisoners gather some mushrums and stuff, to get them off the jail faster
 PLUS: you should count time only when the player is in PRISON. Don't count when he's off-line 8)

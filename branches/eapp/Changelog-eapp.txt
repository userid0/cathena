	* Updated NPCs [massdriller]
06/18
	just to note all the differences of eApp to stable branch
	might be quite incomplete, though; there are lots of playgrounds 
	that I don't explain in detail, just the basics:

	converting function call parameters from pointers
	to references as far as possible, initial step to 
	compound all that stuff into classes

	implemented 64bit compatible usage of time_t
	corrected gettimeofday on windows builds

	checking of comments in config files is
	skipping all whitespace characters
	the "//" is also detected when not at the beginning of the line

	changed dynamic mobs to a different dataset
	_all_ script mobs are created with a cache and each mob
	gets an additional pointer to their corrosponding cache slot
	on creation, allowing to share a common data set among multiple
	mobs created from a common cache slot. this data is not necessary 
	at the mob itself anymore
	the cache is build with counter, so when a mob is spawned on
	the map, the cache counter is decremented, if the mob
	is unloaded, the corrosponding cache counter is incremented
	thus preventing mob duplication
	only non-delayed mobs with a cache are actually unloaded,
	ensuring that guardians, quest mobs and spawned mobs
	are not touched as they do not have a cache
	if a cached master is unloaded, it's slaves are destroyed as well

	introduced slight changes the character file format (txt)
	so be sure to make a backup before trying this version
	otherwise you might not be able to switch back to branch

	change all data to real types for better type checking
	and preperation of automatic transfer buffers

	integrated the anti freeze system into the user count update messages
	(which are already send between chat,login and map)

	changes on map.gat structures and access
	planning on reducing memory usage for this even more
	but still testing the possibilities/effort
	you will need to delete the map cache file from stable branch
	since those are not compatible

	removed parts of RoVeRT's npc timer system

	added forcefull disconnect detection and let the pc online
	for 10 seconds so Alt-F4 cannot be used to flee a fight
	moved the clif_waitclose to the socket

	changes packet processing interaction scheme between
	core socket and parse_func's,
	changed eof to a couple of flags that are used to hold
	the status of the connection, also added access function

	changed all usages of ip numbers to host byte order
	for better consitency,

	simplified and tighted timers a bit

	fix for moving npcs with ontouch event

	reading npcs recursively from folder
	no need to spcify any single script file
	just put path : <path name> to map config
	and have any *.txt file read in

	working npc duplication fix for multimap

	fast socket access
	replacing the loop with IS_FDSET
	is much faster, still testing
	adding different socket handling on WIN32
	it is not exactly the same version I did for jAthena,

	a "real" ShowMessage
	includes a ansi sequence parser for windows and switchable
	calling conventions depending on the compiler

	vararray support for non-gnu compilers
	actually not really a support for that but a macro
	to create and free variable size buffers using
	the fastest supported method for the given compiler

	little/big endian support and memory allignment fixes
	start to make types checking more tight

	c++ compilable with VC and g++
	the makefiles are for solaris,
	so might need to edit linker options on linux
06/10
	* eA++ will now compile on VC.net 2003. Just prepare the appropriate conf files and run.
